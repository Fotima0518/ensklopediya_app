In the 5th century, Athens was at the peak of its economic, political and cultural development. 395-1204 as part of the Byzantine Empire. From 1204 to 1458, it was the capital of the Duchy of Athens. The capital of Greece since 1834.    Athens industry  Athens is the main industrial center of Greece, a major hub of the country's railway, road and air routes.

In Athens, there are textile, tailoring, footwear, food, chemical, oil refining, seminal printing, metallurgical and mechanical engineering (including shipbuilding) industries. Carpets, furniture, and porcelain are produced. Athens is a major commercial and financial center. Athens has the Academy of Sciences (1926), many universities, including the University of Athens (1837), and several history, archeology and art museums (Acropolis, Agora, Byzantium). The main part of the city is between the Acropolis rock and the Lycavittos heights and was built according to a single architectural plan. The oldest part of the city was formed in the 7th century BC. The part of the city around the Acropolis is preserved as an architectural and archeological museum. There are historical monuments of the Athenian state in Athens. The main monument of Athens - the Acropolis is located on a 156 m high rock; Agora, Areopagus and Pnyx hills are the centers of social and political life. The main structures of the Acropolis: Propylaea (437-432 BC), Temple of Nike Apteros (420 BC), Erechtheion (421-406 BC). Temple of Olympian Zeus (2nd century BC-2nd century AD), Lysicrates statue (circa 335 BC), \"Tower of the Winds\" (mid-1st century BC) and others are preserved in Athens. Among the medieval architectural monuments there are churches of Aios - Eleftherios (11th century), Ayi - Apostles (11th century) in Agora. Among the new buildings were the \"Olympia\" theater (1951), \"Hilton Hotel\" (1959-1963). The 1st Olympic Games were held in Athens in 1896.    Ancient Athens  A city-state (polis) of great importance in the history and culture of Greece (now Greece). Athens was born in the mountainous region of Greece called Attica. According to archaeological data, people lived in these places since the Neolithic period. The Atticians worshiped the goddess Athena. The villages of Attica were united to form the city of Athens (9th-8th centuries BC). At this time (Homer's time), military democracy was waning and clan relations were beginning to decay. The power was controlled by clan aristocrats (eupatrides). Mil. av. In the 7th century, the influx of Eupatrides in Ada worsened the situation of the peasants. Mil. av. In 594, Solon became archon (governor) from the merchant aristocracy. He introduced reforms that fundamentally changed the social and political system in Athens. He canceled debts, forbade the sale of slaves due to debt, and dealt a severe blow to the relations of seed production. Political rights and positions were determined depending on people's property. Pisistratus, of aristocratic descent, relying on his followers and mercenaries, declared himself the genius of the Attic peasants in 560 BC and became the absolute governor of Athens. Pisistratus took away the lands of the aristocrats who opposed him and distributed them to the peasants, and introduced money lending to them at the expense of the state. During the reign of Pisistratus, trade relations developed in Athens, a temple and other palaces were built, and a water pipeline was laid. Pisistratus and his sons gathered the best writers in the palace. Homer's \"Odyssey\" and \"Iliad\" were recorded. The first theater was created in Athens. After Pisistratus died (527 BC), power passed to his sons Hippias and Hipparchus. Beijing's autocratic rule did not last long. Hipparchus was killed by the conspirators, and Hippias was deposed (510). Cleisthenes, a large merchant and representative of artisans, led a popular uprising and seized power (508). Instead of four seed-growing districts, he established one regional district. Thus, the last vestiges of the system of the seed-breeding community were abolished. Mil. av. At the beginning of the 5th century, the Greco-Persian wars began. Battle of Marathon (490 BC) Greeks hit the Persians hard. invaded the Roman island. The Greeks won the naval battle near Salamis Island. In Athens, the Union of Delos was formed, consisting of a union of the Aegean states. This alliance later ensured A's dominance in the sea. Wine, olive oil, various crafts were exported from Athens, mainly slaves, grain and wood were brought from abroad. In Athens, the period of Pericles (mid-5th century BC) was an example of an ancient slave democracy. According to the law of Pericles, the People's Assembly, which was attended by all free citizens, was considered the supreme body and discussed all important state affairs, the council of five hundred elected by lot was considered the administrative and control body of the state, and the supreme executive power was in the hands of 10 collegiums of strategists. The years known as the \"Golden Age of Pericles\" were the period of the highest level of development of the Athenian culture. During this period, writers such as historian Herodotus, philosopher Anaxagoras, sculptor Phidias, Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides lived in Athens, and large buildings - palaces - were built. The masters of architecture - Ictinus and Callicrates under the leadership of Phidias built the temple of the goddess Athena - Larfeno. This palace remains one of the best examples of ancient architectural culture. At that time, the language of the Athenian writers (Attic dialect) was widespread and considered a literary language in the Hellenistic states. Pericles' foreign policy aimed at subjugating all of Greece to Athens faced opposition from other groups in the Greek state. Among these groups, the Peloponnesian alliance led by Sparta was prominent. The Peloponnesian Union opposed the democratic system of oligarchy. The conflict between them led to the Peloponnesian War (431-404 BC), which was disastrous for all of Greece. Defeated in the war, Athens lost its leadership position in Greece. But even after this defeat, the state of Athens remained one of the largest centers of culture of the ancient world for a long time. Mil. av. 338 Macedonian King Philip II conquered Greece after the Battle of Chaeronea. Friendly relations between Athens and the Roman Empire continued until 88 BC. On March 1, 86, the Romans captured Athens, many buildings and palaces were destroyed. But the Roman general Sulla, taking into account Athens' past glory, granted her \"freedom\". Mil. av. In 27 AD, all of Greece became a colony of the Roman Empire. Even then, Athens governed itself independently, did not obey the Roman viceroy, and did not pay taxes. Athens did not lose its importance as a scientific and cultural center, rich Romans used to come here to get information. Some of the Roman emperors, especially Hadrian, attached great importance to Athens and built a magnificent building, temples, libraries and gymnasiums. Mil. After the beginning of the barbarian invasion from the 3rd century, Athens went into continuous decline. With the establishment of the Byzantine Empire, the great monuments of art and culture in Athens were taken to Constantinople. In 529, the last schools in Athens were closed by order of the Byzantine emperor Justinian. This is the end of the cultural history of ancient Athens.    Athenian art  Athena (Athena Pallada) is the goddess of war and victory, arts and crafts, knowledge and wisdom in Greek mythology. Daughter of Zeus. Born from the head of Zeus fully armed (with helmet and shield). Patron of the city of Athens. Corresponds to Minerva in Roman legend. In front of the Parthenon temple in Athens, which is a rare monument of Greek art, a large statue of Athena in the form of a brave girl was burned. The name of this goddess was burned in the city of Athens.",
  "alisher_navoiy": "Alisher Navoi",
  "alisher_navoiy_desc":"Alisher Navoi  Alisher Navoi (February 9, 1441 - January 3, 1501) was a poet, thinker and statesman of Uzbek and other Turkic peoples[1][2][3]. In the West, he is considered a great representative of Chigatai literature, and in the East he is honored with the title of \"nizomi millati va din\" (religion and the law of the nation). He studied under teachers such as Sayyid Hasan Ardasher, Pahlavon Muhammad, and collaborated creatively with Abdurahman Jami. Until 1469, Navoi lived far away from Herat due to internal disputes between the Timurids.    After Husayn Boykara ascended the throne of Khurasan (1469), a new stage in Navoi's life and work began, he was appointed to the post of seal (1469), minister (1472) and governorship of Astrobad (1487). will be appointed. During 1480-1500 years, he built several madrasahs, 40 rabats (passenger stops), 17 mosques, 10 houses, 9 baths, 9 bridges, and 20 pools at his own expense. Husayn Boygaro gives Alisher Navoi the title \"Muqarrabi Hazrat Sultani\" (\"the closest person of His Majesty the Sultan\"). According to him, Navoi could intervene in all affairs of the state.    Alisher Navoi's biography was reflected in the works of historians and statesmen such as Khondamir, Vasifi, Husayn Boykara, Babur. His son was born in Herat during the reign of Shahrukh Mirza. Contemporaries often write about him as \"Nizamiddin Mir Alisher\". \"Nizamiddin\" means religious system, and \"mir\" means an amir. His father, Ghiyaziddin Muhammad (also called Ghiyaziddin the Little), was one of the officials of the Timurid palace, one of the trusted people of the family. His mother, Amirzada Shaykh She was the daughter of Abusaid Chang, whose name is not known. It seems that Alisher's grandfather was emikdosh (brother-in-law) with Umarshaikh, the son of Temur.    In his works, the great poet states that he is proud of his proximity to this auspicious shrine. Also, some biographical scenes are found in his works. some information about Tabarruk is given by his contemporaries in their books.    Alisher grew up under special upbringing and supervision because he lived in a palace environment. He fell in love with poetry and music from a young age. He was in the circle of scholars and virtues. At the age of three or four, he met the famous poet of his time Kasim Anvar. He surprised the guests by reciting one of his poems.A year later, they gave him to the school. He studied with the future sultan Husayn Baiqaro. Rumors about his intelligence and talent spread among the people. In 1447, Shahrukh Mirza died, and the struggle for the throne began between Timurid princes. Herat becomes restless. The Alisher family goes to Iraq. On the way, in the city of Taft, he met Sharafiddin Ali Yazdi, the famous historian of Alisher's time, the author of \"Zafarnama\".    The Alisher family returned to Herat in 1451. Historian Khondamir narrates such a related story: while the caravan was going through the Yazd desert to Herat, during one of the night marches, everyone fell asleep on the horses. The horse on which Alisher was riding, the alliance, went off the road, the future poet fell from the saddle, he fell asleep and did not wake up. A galloping horse will not leave its owner and stops.    Alisher wakes up in the morning when the sun is hot. It looks like a bottomless desert, there is no one around. A lone horse pinches its tender roots. A ten-year-old boy catches himself. Riding his horse, he intelligently finds the way and walks forward. The day heats up and thirst begins. At that moment, something black appears in the distance. When he is full of water, he thanks Allah and continues on his way to Alisher. When his parents reach the destination, they find out that their son is not there, and they urgently send the official back. After a short walk, the official meets Alisher. They welcomed Alisher with joy, as if he was reborn.    In 1452, Abulqasim Babur Mirza sat on the throne of Khurasan, and the unrest was suppressed. Ghiyasiddin Muhammad is appointed governor of Sabzavor. Alisher continues his studies. The school introduced young Alisher to the world of poetry and literature. \"Gulistan\" by the future poet Sa'di Shirazy. He read \"Boston\" works, Farididdin Attar's \"Mantiq ut-tayr\" (\"Bird Logic\") with endless enthusiasm. In particular, the stories from the language of birds and their deep meaning captured Alisher's imagination:    One day, the birds gathered together. Various: parrot, hummingbird, peacock, nightingale, etc. Hudhud (sassiqpopishak) came out in the middle. Shaking the crown on his head, he described himself. Then he urged everyone to search for Semrug, the king of the universe. The birds began to question him. \"Tell us the breed, the quality, the quality, give us a badge!\" - they said. Hudhud started a story: Semurg was flying around the world one night. A sudden way i fell over the city of Chin. It was a shock, the country was in need of light. One of the legs fell off. Those who were aware lost their minds. And Chin's property is full of luxury.    The birds fly happily. However, this excitement does not last long. The birds protest, apologize and withdraw. Hudhud answers each one. There is a story that proves that the worries of this world are nothing in front of the happiness of getting pregnant. Hudhud's words and stories give birds a new power. They are the leaders of the region and set off. Hudhud says that death is the path of love, and the person who enters it must, like Sheikh San'an, get rid of his identity. Another fascinating story: Finally, the birds cross seven valleys and realize that they are Semurg. At the end of his life, he wrote a book called \"Lison ut-Tair\" (\"The Language of the Bird\"). The future poet loved to read the works of Nizami Ganjavi and Khusrav Dehlavi again.    In 1453, Alisher's father Ghiyosiddin Mauhammad died. Alisher Abulqasim entered Babur's service. He lived first in Sabzavor, then in Mashhad. Two school friends - Husayn and Alisher were together again. On one occasion, he said that he memorized 50,000 stanzas and 100,000 lines of poetry. Poetry was not only a speech, but also an exercise in enlightenment and thought. At the age of 15, Navoi attracted the attention of famous poets of his time with his poems. According to Khondamir, Alisher, who has just started to become known for his poems, goes to the service of Mavlano Lutfi, a great poet of his time. Maulana asks him to read a poem. Alisher reads his ghazal, which begins with:    Orazin yopgoch, gazimdin sochilur every moment,    I am a star, a hidden sun.    Matla. The old poet, who was amazed by the poem, says: \"By Allah, if I could, I would replace my ten-twelve thousand verses in Persian and Turkish with this ghazal, and I would consider it my great achievement.\" This was a sign that a great talent was entering Turkish (Uzbek) poetry.    Young years  In 1457, Abulqasim Babur died. Abusaid Mirza came to power. Husayn Boygaro plunged into the struggle for the throne.    Navoi continued to study in Mashhad madrasas. Made friends. He met the old poet Kamal Turbati here. Turbatlik got to know this poet Alisher over a verse discussion. The poet returned to Herat in 1464. However, unpleasant things await him in the capital. Abusaid Mirza pursued and tortured the close relatives of Husayn Baiqaro, who was fighting for the throne with him, including his uncles, Mirsaid Kabuli and Muhammad Ali Gharibi, one after the other. They were talented poets. Alisher's father's property was confiscated, and he did not even have a shelter to live in. He could not stay long in the city. However, it was the time when the young poet's creativity was shining. Abdurrahman Jamiyadek got to know the famous writer of his time, learned lessons, and won his love. Navoi - this famous poet and scientist, who was honored as \"Mahmud Nuran\", kept himself away from politics, he even lived outside the city near the tomb of Sa'diddin Koshgari (a famous sheikh who died in 1456, Jami's teacher) and lived there.    Navoi's Sayyid Hasan wrote a poetic letter to Ardasher. It was included in the first divan of \"Khazayin ul-Maani\" under the name \"Masnavi\". Experts consider it to be a letter written by Navoi before leaving Herat for Samarkand. Apparently, the poet wanted to say goodbye to Ardasher before the trip, but did not find him. Then he wrote this letter. The letter begins with the description of Alisher's experiences before the trip and the qualities of Sayyid Hasan Ardasher, whom he saw as his father. It is hard to leave the country and friends. Leaving without saying goodbye is even harder. He wants to explain to his best friend the reasons for his departure. The letter was written on this occasion. A person is great with words, \"the soul of a celestial body\" is a word, or \"poem\" (poetry), says the poet. And he says that he feels a great power to write poetry. Such power that if Firdausi wrote his Shahnama in 30 years, he can write such a work in 30 months. \"Khamsa\", which Nizami Ganjavi spent 30 years on, is a 2-3 year work in front of him. He just needs a chance. The country is in turmoil, people have no loyalty. Inhumane oppression is at its height. Not even a comforter. If you don't have a life partner who will hold you by your side if you say I'm leaving, a friend who will be crushed by separation if you leave.    Navoi lived in Samarkand in the second half of the 60s. They interpret the reason for his coming to this city in different ways. Khondamir says he came to study. In fact, he studied in Samarkand under religious jurist and philosopher Fazullah Abullais. Zahiruddin Babur called him Abusaid sur",
  "avesto": "The sacred text of the Avesta",
  "avesto_desc":"Avesta is not a religion, it is a source of worldly knowledge, historical events, countries where it is spread, socio-economic life of peoples, cultural and spiritual views, religious beliefs, traditions. The main idea expressed in it is that the first simple knowledge of religious faith is connected with the name of the prophet Zarathustra. He created the oldest part of the Avesta \"Gat\" (letter - noma). The knowledge and information included in the Avesta was created in the period that passed from the end of 3000 years to the beginning of 2000 years before 2000 BC, and was transmitted orally from generation to generation, most of it has been lost, from seven part saved. It was collected in the 3rd century BC during the Arshak dynasty.    In religious studies, Avesta is divided into three historical layers: 1. the oldest part is Yasht, which was created in the 3rd millennium BC; they describe the beliefs in the clan system, the imagination of polytheism; 2. It is the part called Ghatlar. It contains fictions about a god named Ahuramazda. It is believed to have been written by Zoroaster. 3. In the conditions of struggle between the ideas of ancient polytheism and later monotheism, the religion of Mazdak was formed, which reconciled both in the 5th century BC. The Avesta was the last and main part of this religion.    The main text of the Avesta, which is characteristic of today's religious studies, was written during the reign of King Khusrau V of the Sassanid dynasty, who ruled Iran in the 6th century, and was later translated into Pahlavi and many comments were made. These are known as \"Zend\".    Avesta was first written on 12,000 cattle skins. (Beruni).    After the collapse of the Sassanid state in the 7th century and the Arab invaders occupying Iran and Central Asia, Zoroastrianism was also hit and its believers were persecuted and persecuted. unitized. Avesta describes the rules of the religious-philosophical system of this religion. He included the worldview, legal, ethical and principle rules of our ancient ancestors. It contains materials and knowledge about natural philosophy, cosmogony, history, ethics, medicine. In it, the king, the upper class, the slave owner, the slave, religious people and religious traditions have a big place in it. Governors and tyrants are glorified; it was claimed that the priests should respect the holy people.    The bottom line is that the Avesta was considered the sacred writing of Zoroastrianism, 3 out of 5 of which were created in 2000 years have been lost. It preached monotheism, no worship of fire, he only recommended its preservation and veneration.    Avesta is the main source and holy book of Zoroastrianism. It was also used in the forms Apastak, Ovisto, Ovusto, Avesto, Avasto. Avesta is an important and unique source for studying the socio-economic life, religious views, visions of the world, traditions, and spiritual culture of the peoples of Central Asia, Iran, and Azerbaijan in the pre-Islamic period. Its contents have been created for nearly two thousand years and have been passed down orally from generation to generation. Before Zoroastrianism became official, fragments of the Avesta were spread among the peoples of Turan and Iran. These fragments, considered to be the divine messages sent by Ahura-Mazda through Zarathustra, began to be collected as various religious prayers and hymns. After the death of Zarathustra, these were collected in a book form and named \"Avesta\" - \"Established, fixed rules\". This ancient written source has not reached us in its entirety. About the Avesta, Abu Rayhan Beruni (d. 1048) writes: \"It is said in the chronicle books: In the treasury of king Darius ibn Darius, there was a copy [of the Avesta] engraved with gold on 12,000 cattle skins. When Alexander destroyed the firehouses and killed those who served in them, he burned it. Therefore, at that time, three-fifths of the Avesta disappeared.\" The fact that Avesta was taken to Greece by Alexander the Great, translated the necessary parts and burned the rest, about the golden text on 12 thousand cattle skins (at-Tabari - 12000 parchments) is written in the Zoroastrian literature created in later periods (\"Bundahishn\", \"Shahrihoi Eron\", \"Dinkard\" ; IX century, \"Arda Viraf-namak\"; IX century, \"Letters of Tansar\", al-Masudi's \"Muruj az-zahab\", \"Fors-nama\" and others) there is information. In these works, it is written that the Greeks destroyed the furnaces, looted the wealth of the temples, killed the religious figures and took them captive. The Avesta that has come down to us now, according to Beruni, is only two-fifths of the original. He wrote that \"Avesta was 30 nasks, about 12 nasks remained in the hands of the pagans (Zoroastrians).\" According to written sources, Avestan verses were indeed passed down from generation to generation.",
  "bobil": "Babil (Iraq) is the ancient capital of the Mesopotamian world",
  "bobil_desc":"Things to Know About Babylon's History and Amazing Architecture    Babylon is the capital of Babylon, one of several city-states in Mesopotamia. Our modern name for our city is a version of the ancient Akkadian name: Bab Ilani or \\\"Gate of the Gods\\\". The ruins of Babylon are located in present-day Iraq, in the modern city of Hilla and on the east bank of the Euphrates River. Assyria)  Middle Bronze Age (2000-2500 BC) (Old Babylon, Isin-Larsa)  Jemdet Nasr 2500-3000 BC (Early Dynastic)  Late Chalcolithic / Late Uruk 3000-3500 BC   Humans first lived in Babylon at least at the end of the 3rd millennium BC, and it was the political center of southern Mesopotamia beginning in the 18th century, during the reign of Hammurabi (1792-1750 BCE). Mil. Avv. 300 B.C., Babylon is significant for the astonishing 1,500-year-old city.  ad    The City of Hammurabi  The description of the ancient city of Babylon, in contrast, lists the names of the city and its temples as \\\"Tintir = Babylon\\\" found in the text, because its first sentence \\\"Tintir\\\" is a willing Babylonian with glory and joy. This document is a collection of important Babylonian architecture and it is about mil. Avv. Compiled in 1225, during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar I.    Tintir describes 43 temples and ten towns, gathered by the quarter of the city in which they were located, as well as the city walls, waterways, and streets.     What else do we know about the ancient city of Babylon, archaeological excavations. In the early 20th century, German archaeologist Robert Koldewey excavated a 21-meter-deep pit to discover the Temple of Esagila.    By the 1970s, a joint Iraqi-Italian team led by Giancarlo Bergamini re-examined the ruins, which had been reduced to deep soil. But other than that, we don't know much about the city of Hammurabi because it was destroyed in ancient history.    Babylon sacked  According to the Babylonian inscriptions, Babylon's rival Assyrian king Sennacherib sacked the city in 689 BC. . Sennacherib praised him for destroying all the buildings and throwing the bridge into the Euphrates. In the following century, Babylon was renovated by Chaldean rulers who followed the old city plan. Nebuchadnezzar II (604-562) undertook a major construction project and signed many of Babylon's buildings. The city of Nebuchadnezzar, which begins with the amazing accounts of Mediterranean historians.    The city of Nebuchadnezzar  Nebuchadnezzar's Babylon was enormous, covering an area of 900 hectares (2,200 acres): it was the Mediterranean until the Roman Empire. was the largest city in the region. The city lay in a triangle measuring 2.7x4x4.5 kilometers (1.7x2.5x2.8 mi) and consisted of the bank of the Euphrates and other walls and a moat. Crossing the Euphrates and intersecting the triangle was the city's rectangular (2.75x1.6 km or 1.7x1 mi) inner city, where most of the major monumental palaces and temples were located. At times, this led to the location of the center. The inner city was surrounded by two walls and a moat, connecting the eastern and western parts to each other or to several bridges. The mighty gates gave access to the city: more on that later.    Temples and palaces  The main house of Babylon was in the center: in Nebuchadnezzar's day it consisted of 14 temples. The most important of these is Marduk's complex of deities, including Esagila (\"Their Most High\") and his great ziggurat, Etemenanki (\"House and Foundation of Heaven and Underworld\"). The temple of Marduk is surrounded by a wall next to seven gates, protected by a bronze dragon statue. The ziggurat, 80 meters (260 ft) across the wide street from the temple of Marduk, was also surrounded by high walls, with nine doors guarded by a bronze dragon.    The main palace reserved for official business in Babylon was the South Palace. , was a huge throne room decorated with lions and stylized trees. The North Chamber, thought to be the residence of the Chaldean rulers, contained mysterious lapis lazuli reliefs. Among its ruins were found a large collection of antiquities collected by the Chaldeans from various places around the Mediterranean. The Northern Palace could be a candidate for the Gardens of Babylon; Although no evidence has been found, more places outside of Babylon are identified (see Dally).    Babylon's Reputation  In the Christian Bible, Revelation (chapter 17), Babylon is referred to as \"Babylon the great, the mother of harlots and the shame of the earth.\" describing it as evil and depravity everywhere. It was a religious propaganda that was compared to Jerusalem and the chosen cities of Rome and warned against becoming. This concept was discovered by German excavators of the ancient city at the end of the 19th centuryng brought parts of the house and covered them in a museum in Berlin, including the dark blue Ishtar Gate with bulls and dragons.    Other historians marvel at the city's incredible size. The Roman historian Herodotus [484-425 AD] wrote about Babylon in the first book of his history books (chapters 178-183). However, scholars do not know whether Herodotus actually saw Babylon or heard about it. It has been described as a much larger city than archaeological evidence, claiming that the city walls stretched around 480 stadia (90 km).    The 5th-century Greek historian Ctesias, who probably visited in person, said the city walls were 66 km (360 stadia) said to be stretched. Aristotle described it as \"a city the size of a nation\". He says that it takes three days to get the news that Cyrus the Great has conquered the outskirts of the city to the center.    The Tower of Babel  According to the Genesis of the Judeo-Christian Bible, the Tower of Babel was built to ascend to heaven. As scientists believe, the book \\\"Etemenanki ziggurat\\\" became a source of inspiration for legends. According to Herodotus, the ziggurat had an eight-story strong central tower. The ramparts could be climbed up an outer spiral staircase, and about halfway there was a resting place.    On the 8th floor of the Etemenanki ziggurat, there was a large chapel with a large, richly decorated couch, and a golden table next to it. No one was allowed to spend the night here, Herodotus said, except for a specially selected Assyrian woman. It was removed by Alexander the great when he conquered Babylon in the 4th century BC.

  "bobur": "Babur Mirza",
  "bobur_desc":"Babur (pseudonym; full name Zahiriddin Muhammad ibn Umarshaikh Mirza; February 14, 1483 - December 26, 1530) is a major representative of Uzbek classic literature, poet, historian, geographer, statesman, talented general, founder of the Babur dynasty, Timurid. was a king. Amir was a pannevara of Temur.[1] Babur was one of the great personalities of his time. His poems and rubai are read with love in their time and even now. He had 6 wives. Bibi Mubaraka, Mohimbegim, Zainab Sultan Begim, Aisha Sultan Begim, Masuma Sultan Begim and Saliha Sultan Begim. She was the daughter of the governor of Tashkent, Yunus Khan. On his father's side, Babur was descended from the third son of Amir Temur, Mironshah Mirza, and on his mother's side, he was descended from Khizr Khoja Khan, the son of Tughluq Temur Khan, and was his seventh generation.    From his father's side:    Amir Temur Koragon (1336-1405)  Mironshah Mirza (1366-1408)  Sultan Muhammad Mirzo (1398-1444)  Sultan Abu Said Koragon (1424-1469)  Umarshaykh Mirzo Koragon (1456-1494)   nBabur (1483-1530)  On his mother's side:    Tughluq Temurkhan (1329-1362)  Khizr Khojakhan (1358-1399)  Muhammad Khan (? - 1416)  Sharalikhan (did not ascend the throne)  Uwaiskhan (1418- 1425 years)  Yunus Khan (1468-1487)  Yunus Khan's daughter Qutlugh Nigorkhanim (1457-1504)  Babur (1483-1530)  Babur's mother was an educated and intelligent woman who actively supported Babur in the management of power, military accompanied him on his journeys. Umarshaikh Mirza's family lived in the arch of Andijan, the capital city. The governor spent the summer months on the banks of the Syrdarya, in Akhsi, and the rest of the year in Andijan. Babur spent his youth in Andijan. Like all Timurid princes, Babur studied military education, jurisprudence, Arabic and Persian languages under the tutelage of special tutors and great religious scholars, read many historical and literary works, became interested in science and poetry. Because of his bravery and bravery, he received the nickname \"Babur\" (\"Lion\") from his youth.    Babur follows the path of his father, devotes himself to the famous Sufi Khwaja Ahror, and grows up in the spirit of his order, remaining faithful to this belief until the end of his life. Later, in the work \"Baburnoma\", Babur Khwaja Ahror's spirit repeatedly saved him from inevitable destruction, illness and helplessness, and he pointed out that he guided him in the most difficult conditions. After his father died prematurely and tragically at the age of 39 in Akhsi, the eldest son of the family, 12-year-old Babur ascended the throne as crown prince (June 1494). it was fragmented into many provinces that became almost independent, headed by feuding Timurid princes or landed gentry. The struggle for the Movarounnahr throne was in full swing, various political conspiracies were being organized. On top of that, several beks and governors subordinate to Umarshaikh Mirza refused to obey the young ruler (Babur). Some of them support Babur's brothers, some claim independence, others are opponents of Babur, others join their uncles and uncles and come to the point of losing him physically. In the first 2-3 years of Babur's reign, Babur, who repelled the attacks of his uncle and uncle, Sultan Ahmed Mirza, and Sultan Mahmud Khan, implemented important measures such as strengthening his position, improving relations with governors and officials, bringing order to the army, and establishing discipline in state affairs. Babur's initial political goal was to capture Samarkand, the capital of Amir Temur's state, which was strategically and geographically important, and to preserve and strengthen a strong state centered in Movarunnahr and restore Amir Temur's kingdom.    Babur's recapture of Andijan    Babur's accession to the throne, 1495 yil  At this time, in a short period of time, the third ruler came to the throne of Samarkand. After the death of Sultan Ahmad Mirza (July 1494), Sultan Mahmud Mirza did not rule the state in Samarkand for more than 5-6 months - he died at the age of 43 after a short illness. He will be succeeded by his son Boysungur, who is the governor of Bukhara. In 1495-1496, Babur made two unsuccessful campaigns to Samarkand. In the fall of 1497, he captured several places around Samarkand and after a 7-month siege of Samarkand, Boysungur fled to Kunduz. The city was going through extremely difficult times due to the siege. It was difficult to find even grain. Babur faced great difficulties in providing the army. Some of the servants flee to Andijan and Akhsi. After that, some of the begs who remained in Andijan turned their backs on Babur and joined his brother Jahangir Mirza. From Andijan, who was depressed and had economic difficulties, at the same time he was seriously ill. Babur, who forgave him, decided to leave Samarkand after 100 days, but when he reached Khojand, he heard that Andijan had also been lost and had been taken over by the opponents. Babur's attempt to recapture Andijan with the support of his uncle Mahmudkhan, governor of Tashkent, was unsuccessful. This failure had a negative impact on Babur's army, and many beks and navkars (700-800 people) left Babur. After staying in Khojand for some time, Babur, who remained with his loyal men (200-300), came to Tashkent to meet Mahmud Khan and began to make a plan to recapture Andijan. After a certain period of time, Babur returned to Khojand, and soon after, he captured Margilon and oversaw the capture of Andijan. Finally, after 2 years (June 1498), he regains it. Babur made peace with his brother Jahangir Mirza and left the \"provinces on the Akhsi side of the Khojand River...\" at his disposal, and took control of the Andijan side provinces.    Efforts to conquer Samarkand    Babur in Samarkand  When the internecine wars of the Timurids intensified, Shaybani Khan conquered Movarunnahr. begins to do. In 1499, he traveled through Jizzakh and Samarkand to Karshi and Shahrisabz, returning to Dashti Kipchak with a large booty. Soon after that, Shaibani Khan, who returned to Movarounnahr with a large force, captured Bukhara and Karakol (1499), Sultan Ali Mirza reluctantly handed over Samarkand to Shaibani Khan without a fight (1500), but a certain part of the city's inhabitants and nobles supported the restoration of Timurid rule. They sent a letter to the governor of Ferghana, Babur, and invited him to occupy Samarkand. When Babur arrived in Samarkand with his army (240 people) in the late autumn of 1500, the people greeted him and opened the city gates. Shaibani Khan's 600 soldiers left to protect the city will be destroyed. Shaibani Khan retreats to Bukhara. In a short time, Babur's governorship was recognized in all districts of Samarkand, in the cities of Karshi and Guzor, but food stocks ran out in the city and famine began. When Shaibani Khan learned about this, he gathered a lot of strength and started marching to Samarkand again. In April 1501, Babur's troops were defeated in a battle near the village of Saripul on the Zarafshan River. Babur retreats to Samarkand. The city was besieged again for four months. The inhabitants of the besieged city were starving, and Babur left Samarkand out of desperation in the second half of 1501 and went to Tashkent, to Mahmud Khan.    The Timurids, Babur and Shaibani  Shaibani Khan's grandfather, Abul Khair Khan, succeeded Babur's grandfather Abu Said in the Timurid state in 1451. helped to come. At the same time, Abul Khair Khan's daughter Khanzada married Abu Said. The grandson of his daughter was buried in the Gori Amir mausoleum of the Timurid family in Samarkand[2].    Uzbek Khan Abulkhairkhan married Ulugbek's daughter Rabia Sultan Beg (died 1485) in 1450. Sultans Suyunchhojakhan, Kochkunchikhan and Aq Burun were born from their marriage. Suyunchhojakhan and Kochkunchikhans had a great influence among the Shaybanites and ruled over Turkestan, Tashkent and Movarounnahr. After the death of Kochkunchi Khan, Muhammad Shaibani Khan ruled the Shaibani state [3]. Shaibani Khan married Aisha Sultan, the cousin of Babur, Mahmud Khan's daughter, who was known as Mughal Khan and was his respected wife until the end of the Khan's life. Another cousin of Babur, Qutluk Khanim, was married to Jonibek Sultan in Shaybanyza[4].    In 1519, Babur sent the manuscript of his poetry collection to Samarkand to the poet Polat Sultan Shaybani, the son of Kochkunjikhan[5].    In the 1520s, Babur and Shaybanys established good relations. As Babur himself stated, during the invasion of India in 1526-1527, Uzbek generals - sultans: Kasim Husayn Sultan, Bihub Sultan, Tang Atmish Sultan, as well as Mahmud Khan Nukhani from Ghazipur, Baba Kashka, Tulmish Uzbek, Qurban Chahri fought on his side.     In 1528, the Shaibani sent ambassadors to Babur to congratulate him on his victory in India.[6]    Babur's departure from Mowaroonnahr  Babur worked hard to protect and preserve the Timurid kingdom, fighting against Shaibani Khan for several years. however, it will not achieve its goal in the conditions of severe economic stress and political disorder prevailing in the country. In 1503, Tashkent Khan Mahmud Khan, Babur and the combined army of the Kalmyks were defeated by Shaibani Khan on the banks of the Syrdarya. While Babur was fighting for the Samarkand throne, Andijan was captured by Sultan Ahmed Tanbal. In 1501-1504, Babur's struggle against Sultan Ahmad Tanbal and Jahangir mirzas to recover the property of Ferghana ended in failure. Tired of constant battles and heavy taxes of Timurids and the people did not support Babur and he was forced to leave Mowaroonnahr (June 1504).    Capture of Kabul    Coin struck by Babur in Kabul, 1507-1508    Babur's warriors, 1520s  Babur 200 - With his army of 300 people, he passes through the Hissar mountains to Afghanistan and takes advantage of the internal conflicts there to occupy Ghazni and Kabul. After taking over Kabul, Babur began to build an independent state, organized the army, and established strict internal discipline. Babur treated Kabul and Afghanistan in general as his own country, started construction, beautification, development of trade and agriculture. He established camps such as \"Bogi Shakhroro\", \"Bogi Jahonoro\", \"Ortabog\", \"Bogi Wafa\" and \"Bogi Babur\". He made the Bolo Hissar fortress inside the city his residence, renovated it, built new buildings and lived in this fortress with his family. His children Humayun, Gulbadanbegim, Komron and Hindol were born here. Mirza Ulugbek, who died in the spring of 1506, will be buried in the Navrozi Garden built here. Babur was active in Afghanistan not as a conqueror, but as an active ruler who sacrificed his life for the prosperity and prosperity of this country. acted fairly and reasonably in his interests. According to his practical activities in Afghanistan, Babur gained a great reputation as a powerful head of state and a victorious general in the whole of Khurasan and Mowarunnahr, and the political life in the region rose to prominence. The fact that Sultan Husayn Boykara specially invited Babur, among all the Timurid rulers, to the consultation meeting in the matter of taking joint measures against the increasing Shaybanite march, is a proof of such a high influence. Babur went to Herat on this proposal. Despite the sudden death of Husayn Boykara (1506), he went to Herat and held talks with Timurid rulers. The plans of the Timurid rulers to unite and block Shaibani Khan's forces will not be realized, and soon they will be defeated one after another and the kingdom will be completely lost.    In the beginning of 1507, Babur starts marching to India, but this attempt fails and he returns to the capital Kabul.  \\ Babur monitors the political situation and war activities in Mowarounnahr and Khurasan, and keeps his troops always ready. Shaibani Khan, after capturing the major centers of Khurasan, began a campaign to conquer Iran, but was defeated in a fierce battle with the Iranian king Ismail Safavi (1510), and he himself died in Marv. Shah Ismail sent troops to Khurasan and Movaroonnahr and began to harm the Shaybanites one after another. Babur formed a military-political alliance with Shah Ismail and captured Hisar in the spring of 1511, Bukhara in the summer, and Samarkand again in early October. The fact that Babur's dealings with the opinion of Iranians, a Shiite leader, caused discontent among the population. On April 28, 1512, in the battle of Koli Malik, Ubaydulla Sultan, the chief, defeated the Shaybanites, and Babur went to Hisar. In the autumn of 1512, Babur met the commander of the army named Najmi Soni, sent by Shah Ismail, in Balkh, crossed the Amudarya, first took Huzar (Guzar) fortress, then marched to Karshi, the city surrendered after a long siege, and the defenders of the city were severely punished. On November 24, 1512, Babur was again defeated by the Shaybanites in the Battle of Gijduvan and was forced to return to Kabul. Babur quickly gave up on the idea of conquering Mowaroonnahr and turned his attention to India.    Conquest of India    Babur in India, 1527.  By the spring of 1519, Babur began to implement plans for the conquest of India, and for the next 5-6 years organizes several marches.      Uzbek sultans Hamza Sultan, Mahdi Sultan, Mamaq Sultan Babur received  Finally, in April 1526, in Panipat, he crushed the hundred thousand army of his main rival, Delhi Sultan Ibrahim Lodi with 12 thousand soldiers. and captures Delhi.    Soon after that, he won over the second largest Indian general, Rano Sango, and subjugated the northern part of India up to Bengal.    Choosing Agra as his capital, Babur started large-scale construction and improvement works. In this way, Babur founded the powerful Babur dynasty, which ruled India for about three and a half centuries.    Contribution to the development of India  Babur did many social good deeds in India as well as in Afghanistan, and had a significant impact on the development of the country. He put an end to disunity and disunity, mutual internal conflicts and massacres, unified the regions, paid great attention to the strengthening of the centralized state and improvement of the country, the development of science, crafts and agriculture. He led the construction works. He is considered the author of various ghazals.    Creation as a poet the beginning of his career  According to Babur's own testimony, his creative career as a poet began when he occupied Samarkand for the second time; \"On those occasions, I used to recite a couple of verses,\" he wrote. In the first months of Babur's stay in Samarkand, Alisher Navoi initiated a correspondence between them. It was during these years that artists began to gather around Babur. In particular, the rubai discussion between Binai, Abulbaraka and Babur indicates the intense literary life in Samarkand. In general, as a statesman and a general who spent a lot of time in battles, Babur was able to find time for creative work even in the most intense period of his social activity, and when his personal life and state were in extremely complicated and dangerous conditions, he gathered and patronized the people of science, art and creativity around him. , who encouraged them.    Babur, well-versed in literature and history, music and art, devoted to religious teachings, was always in the circle of scholars and virtuous people, in particular, he showed sincere respect to the people of creativity, and patronized them. provided material and spiritual encouragement. Such loving attitude towards people of creativity and art was not in vain. Babur was creative by nature. From his youth to the end of his life, he was engaged in effective creative work, he did not stop creating even in any conditions and situations, as a result, he left an important rich scientific and literary legacy. His rabid ghazal \"Topmadim\" and the verse beginning with the verse \"Yod etmas emish kishini ghurbatda kishi\" are related to his life in those years.    Babur's great artistry is that he can raise his personal experiences to the level of serious generalization, and as a result, the ideas advanced in his works rise to the level of universal values. . In Babur's work, especially in his poetry, the heartfelt longing for the motherland where the umbilical blood was spilled, the longing for its soil, the bitter sorrow from the sufferings of foreignness, the longing for the country and the longing for the homeland, the blows of destiny and the sufferings of life, the lamentation of the failures of the times are analyzed artistically.  \\ In Babur's work, the themes of love, loyalty, visal and hijran also play an important role. In his ghazals and rubai, tuyuq and masnavis, the charming beauty of the lover, incomparable beauty, oriental manners, gentleness and grace are glorified with great skill in light and playful, musical and fluent verses. , there are no known exact historical data indicating the date of its establishment. However, in the chapter of \"Boburnoma\" dedicated to the events of 1518-1519, it is mentioned that Babur sent his cabinet from Kabul to Samarkand. So, during these years, his divan was organized and this divan was also distributed in Movarounnahr.    Currently, 119 ghazals, one masnu poem, 209 rubai'is, more than 10 verses and verses, more than 50 problems and more than 60 fards have been identified. The collection includes 8 masnavis with a total volume of 270 verses.    The work \"Mubayyin\"  In 1521, during his campaigns to India, Babur created the work \"Mubayyin\". Written in the style of Masnavi, this work is devoted to Islamic jurisprudence and Sharia beliefs and contains interesting information about Mowarounnahr and the socio-economic life of that time in India. In the \"Mubayyin\", which was intended as a program for Crown Prince Humayun and Kamran Mirza, at the same time, Shari'a standards were also stated about prayer, zakat and pilgrimage. During these years, Babur completed his scientific treatise on one of the main issues of Eastern poetry, aruz weight, its theory and practice. He started his creative work on the royal work \"Baburnoma\", which made Babur's name famous in the world, in 1518-19.    In addition to the above-mentioned works, Babur also had a number of treatises specially dedicated to music and military affairs, but the next two The text of the work has not yet been found. In Khatti Baburi, the author edited the Arabic alphabet and adapted it to the Turkish language and pronunciation standards in order to simplify and facilitate writing. Babur's poisoning Babur's tomb, Kabul On December 21, 1526, an assassination attempt was organized against Babur. The mother of Ibrahim Lodi, who was destroyed, colluded with the cooks and added poison to his food. Whether it is a complication or the effect of many years of hard and restless life, in any case, in the following years, Babur often fell ill.    In October 1527, when Babur fell ill again, he felt that his life was over. Then Babur prayed for the salvation of the soul of Khoja Ahror Vali, whom he believed in, and sincerely translated his prose work \"Validiya\" into poetry. This work of 243 stanzas, which shows Babur's ability as a skilled translator, was completed in a very short time with great creative inspiration. Babur's own confession, transsoon after the end of the month, he completely recovered. During these years, he continued to work on the seasons of \"Boburnoma\", created new ghazals and rubai, arranged, in his own words, \"Aitkan Ash'ar coming to India\", as well as the translation of \"Validiya\", samples and verses written by \"Hatti Baburiy\". He sent Khumayun, Khwaja Kalon, Hindol and others to Movarounnahr and Afghanistan. His famous letter to Humayun Mirza analyzing socio-ethical issues was one of the bright aspects of Babur's creative activity.    Babur, who handed over the kingdom to Humayun some time ago, died at the age of 47 in Agra, the capital of the kingdom he founded, and was buried there, later (1539 ), according to his will, the horse was brought to Kabul and placed in the \"Babur's Garden\" that he built.

One of the central streets in Andijan, as well as an amusement park and street in Tashkent, an amusement park in the city of Khanabad, Andijan region, were named after Bobur. The medal of the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan named after Babur was established. Oriental scholar Ubaidulla Karimov was the first laureate of this medal.    Study of Babur's work  Study of Babur's work was launched in 1958. This year, a large scientific conference was organized in Tashkent.

  "buyuk_ipak_yo'li": "The Great Silk Road",
  "buyuk_ipak_yo'li_desc": "This term has other meanings. See: The Great Silk Road (meanings).  The Great Silk Road is an ancient trade route connecting the East and the West, a unique event in the history of human development, its desire to unite and exchange cultural values, to reach markets for the sale of living space and products. Before the sea and ocean roads were opened, these roads became important.    According to the saying in the East: \"The one who sits is a mat, the one who walks is the river.\" Movement is life, travel, globalization has always been the driving force of development. This intercontinental trade route, the largest in human history, connected Europe and Asia and in the past stretched from the ancient Roman state to Nara, the ancient capital of Japan. Of course, trade between the East and the West had been carried on since ancient times, sunk in the depths of the past, but these were isolated parts of the future Great Road. The formation of trade relations was greatly helped by the discovery and mining of semi-precious stones in the mountains of Central Asia - lapis lazuli, nephrite, agate, and turquoise, which are highly valued in the East. For example, there was a \"lazurite road\" that supplied lapis lazuli from Central Asia to Iran, Mesopotamia and even Egypt. At the same time, the \"jade road\" was formed, which connected Khotan and Yorkend districts with the regions of North China. In addition, agate stones were brought to the countries of East Asia from Sogdiana and Bactria, and turquoise was brought from Khorezm. All these directions eventually merged into the Great Silk Road. Historians believe that the real beginning of the great road connecting the caravan routes from Central Asia to the West and South and the roads leading from China to Eastern Turkestan dates back to the middle of the second century BC, when the Chinese first discovered the Western lands - the Central Asian countries.       Marco Polo's journey in 1271-1295  History  The first transcontinental caravan route that connected East and West countries in ancient and medieval times (2nd century BC - 15th century AD). The term Great Silk Road is associated with the precious commodity that was transported along this route - Chinese silk. Western countries have been ignorant of the secrets of silk production for a long time.    The term Great Silk Road was not used in ancient times. The scientific study of the historical, geographical and cultural aspects of the Great Silk Road was actually started by scientists of many countries in the second half of the 19th century. Scientists from Western Europe, Russia and Japan made a significant contribution to its research. In particular, \"Encyclopedia of the Great Silk Road\" was published in Japan. In 1877, the famous German scientist Karl Richthofen in his major scientific work \"China\" called the system of roads connecting different parts of the huge Eurasian continent \"Silk Road\", later the term \"Great Silk Road\" was adopted.    Even up to the 2nd century BC There were connections between the East and the West through the Central Asian caravan routes. An example of this can be the objects made in Asia Minor, found in the Poziryk fortress in the Altai Mountains, and the Greek objects found in Afghanistan and Central Asia. With the formation of the kingdom of Alexander the Great (see Alexander the Great), these relations were put on the right track. The Sugdians played a major role in the establishment of the eastern part of the Great Silk Road. After Alexander the Great conquered the Sugdian country, many Sugdians moved to the east and built trade factories (locations) in the central part of the Great Silk Road - from Central Asia to the Chinese city of Chanan. In turn, the Han Empire at the end of the 1st millennium BC pursued a policy of expanding its territory towards Central Asia, paying special attention to this direction and sending the ambassador Zhang Xiang to collect information about this route, for espionage and diplomatic purposes. However, the first detailed route from Hierapolis, east of the Mediterranean Sea in Syria, to Serica, China, was made by the Macedonian merchant Mai Titian (100 AD). This information is stored in Claudius Ptolemy's \"Geographic Manual\". Ptolemy, in turn, obtained this information from the works of the historian Marin, written between 107 and 114 years and which have not reached us. Based on this information, the Great Silk Road is divided into 2 sections: from Hierapol to Tashminor (Tashkurgan) and from Tashminor to Serika. The Central Asian part of the road started from Aria (the ancient region located in the south of present-day Turkmenistan and the north-west of Afghanistan). The road from Aria to the north is Margiy He went to Antioch (the ruins of the ancient city of Marv near the city of Bairamali), then turned east and went to Bactra (the city of Balkh in northern Afghanistan). From here, the road headed north, crossed Amudarya around Termiz, and then went in 2 directions. The first one went along the northern one through the Iron Gate to Morocco (Samarkand), and from there to Fergana. The second one in the south led along the Surkhandarya valley to the mountainous land of the Comedians (now Karategin). Both directions lead to Tashminor. Some scientists believe that it is located in the Tashkent region, others in the Olay Valley. After Tashminor, the road went out of the territory of Central Asia, around Ergashtom there was a \"trader's settlement\", then the road passed through the Takla Makon desert to Dunhuang, and then to Chanan, the ancient capital of China. From here, the road probably went northwest to Korea and Japan. In the 5th-8th centuries AD, the northern part of the Great Silk Road through Yettisuv to Choch (Tashkent oasis), Sughd, then Poykend, Marv to Iran's Khurasan became important. At the same time, in connection with the ban on silk transportation to Byzantium through Iran, Sughd merchants, through the mediation of Byzantine and Turkish khans, opened a new road network from Sughd and Khorezm, bypassing the Caspian Sea, passing through the passes in the North Caucasus, to the Black Sea and then to Constantinople. With the help of silk, which was valued in the West as high as gold and precious stones, the Byzantine emperors recruited warriors from Europe and won over the rulers of the neighboring \"barbarian\" - Germanic and Slavic tribes, because silk was considered more valuable to them. At this time, silk became the object of economic competition between 3 great powers: the Byzantine Empire, Sassanid Iran and the great Turkic Khanate. However, this \"silk\" route apparently did not exist for long, as China lost its monopoly on silk production in the second half of the 6th century, and by the end of the century Byzantium was producing so much silk that there was no need to import it from China. The history of the Great Silk Road ends with the establishment of the Byzantine silk industry and its gradual spread to the countries of the Caucasus and the Mediterranean. In the following centuries, especially during the reign of the Mongols, although there are many evidences of the existence of a caravan route connecting the East and the West, the name \"silk road\" can be conditionally applied to it, because the importance of this road was no longer marked by silk, but by other goods and purposes.       The Great Silk Road between the Byzantine Empire and the Chinese Empire (555)  In 1987, UNESCO adopted the international program \"Silk Road - the Road of Communication\" as part of the UN World Decade for Cultural Development. This program provides a comprehensive study of the rich cultural history of the peoples of Central Asia. However, its main goal is to establish stronger cultural and economic ties between the East and the West, to improve relations between the numerous peoples living on these great continents. Many (more than 30) international scientific conferences (including Samarkand, October 1990; Bukhara, February 1996) and seminars were held. The Great Silk Road joint international expeditions were organized, films were made, books, brochures and articles were published, some archaeological and architectural monuments were repaired. In some Eastern countries (India, China, Uzbekistan, Sri Lanka, Japan), special scientific institutes have been established to study the Great Silk Road. According to the decision of Maye, UN and UNESCO, the International Institute of Central Asian Studies was opened in Samarkand. In May 1997, the construction of the Sarakhs-Mashhad railway section connecting Central Asia with Iran was completed, thus Central Asian countries had access to the Persian Gulf, and European countries had access to Central Asia. In addition to scientific and cultural programs, a project of global importance is being implemented to restore the Great Silk Road (see Europe-Caucasus-Asia Transport Corridor (TRACECA)). The next task is to build a railway section between Uzbekistan and China. If this plan is implemented, the \"railway\" version of the Great Silk Road will be fully restored from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean.      Silk Road in the 1st century  Uzbekistan is paying great attention to the restoration of the Great Silk Road. On June 2, 1995, the first President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, issued a decree on measures to increase Uzbekistan's participation in the reconstruction of the Great Silk Road and to develop international tourism in the republic (see also: Great Silk Road tourist destinations).",

  "chichan_itza_desc":"Chichen Itza  Chichen Itza is one of the ancient cities partially restored during excavations. It is located in Mexico, near Cancun. In the past, it was the political and cultural center of the Mayan civilization. And although today this area is abandoned by the inhabitants, the sights are considered a UNESCO heritage, so tourists come to see the ancient buildings with their own eyes, not in pictures.    Chichen Itza's history summary  From history, everyone knows about the Mayan tribe, but by the time the Spanish came to the Yucatan Peninsula, only scattered settlements remained of a large population. The ancient city of Chichen Itza is an indisputable proof that civilization was once very powerful and this knowledge can still be admired today.    The beginning of the construction of the city dates back to the 6th century. Architecture can be roughly divided into two eras: Maya and Toltec. The first buildings appeared in the 6th-7th centuries, the next buildings were erected in the 10th century after the occupation by the Toltecs.    In 1178, the city was partially destroyed after the invasion of Hunak Kil. In 1194, the formerly prosperous center was almost completely abandoned. It was still used for pilgrimage purposes, but for unknown reasons, with the unusual architecture and infrastructure developed at that time, people did not return to the city. In the 16th century, it was already completely abandoned, because the Spanish conquerors encountered only ruins.    Sights of the ancient city  When visiting Chichen Itza, it is difficult to ignore the monumental buildings of the city, which still amaze with their scale today. The visiting card is the temple of Kukulkan, which is a pyramid with a height of 24 meters. The Mayans worshiped divine beings in the form of feathered serpents, so they hid a wonderful miracle in the design features of the pyramid of Kukulkan.        On the autumn and spring equinoxes, the sun's rays fall on the slopes of the building, so that they are seven equilateral. forms the shadows of the triangle. These geometric shapes combine as a whole to form a snake that crawls along a pyramid measuring 37 meters. The spectacle lasts almost 3.5 hours and gathers a large crowd around it every year.    ad  Also, during the tours, they should tell about the Temple of Warriors and the Temple of Jaguar, which are painted with unusual paintings. . In the Temple of Warriors, you can see the ruins of thousands of columns, each of which is carved with images of warriors. In those days, astronomy was of great importance to the inhabitants, so it is not surprising that there was an observatory in the ancient city. The staircase has a spiral shape, so the building is called Karakol, which translates as \"snail\". One of the sad places of the city is the sacred cenote, where there is a well with the remains of animals and people. During the Toltec period, sacrifice played an important role in religion, but many child skeletons have been found here. Scientists still do not know why children were needed for these rituals. Perhaps this secret remains hidden within the walls of Chichen Itza.    Interesting facts  For the Maya, astronomy was at the top of everything, and many nuances in architecture are related to time and calendar features. For example, the temple of Kukulkan has nine floors, and a staircase on each side divides the pyramid in two. As a result, 18 layers are formed, the same number of months in the Mayan calendar. There are 91 steps in each of the four steps, making a total of 365 steps, which is the number of days in the year.  Interestingly, the locals like to play pot-ta-pok with a ball. 'rard. Several playgrounds attest to this. The largest one is 135 meters long and 68 meters wide. Around it there are temples in every part of the world. Guides usually show you how to get to the sports fields and explain the rules of the game.    Chichen Itza can easily surprise because the city impresses with its scale. It seems that everything has been thought out down to the smallest detail, so it is not clear why the inhabitants left it. The secrets of history will probably remain unsolved forever, and this is even more interesting for tourists",
  "efel": "The Eiffel Tower",
  "efel_desc":"Eiffel Tower  How is France? Does the Eiffel Tower mean a lot to the French? France is nothing without Paris, and Paris is nothing without the Eiffel Tower! As Paris is the heart of France, the Eiffel Tower is the heart of Paris! It is strange to imagine now, but there was a time when they wanted to deprive this city of its heart. in the next 100 years (1789) and within 10 years of the proclamation of the Third Republic under the leadership of a Nationally elected President, it was planned to show the world its technical achievements. a meeting There was an urgent need for a structure that would act as an entrance arch to the exhibition and at the same time impress with its originality. This belt should have remained in everyone's memory as one of the symbols of the Great French Revolution - it should not have stood on the hated Bastille Square! In 20-30 years, the entrance arch is not something that should be destroyed, the main thing is to remember it! About 700 projects were considered: the best architects offered their services, including not only the French, but also the commission prik engineer preferred the project of Alexandre Gustave Eiffel. It is rumored that he simply \"criticized\" this project from an ancient Arab architect, but no one has been able to confirm this. The truth, reminiscent of the famous French Chantilly lace, was discovered only half a century after the 300-meter Eiffel Tower, as a symbol of Paris and France itself, has already entered the minds of people who immortalized the name of its creator. and use perforated structures to build their strong skeletons. For example, for deep-sea fish or sea sponges, radiolarians (protozoa) and starfish. Not only the variety of design solutions related to the skeleton, but also the \"material economy\" in their construction, as well as the maximum strength of structures that can withstand the enormous hydrostatic pressure of a huge water mass. used to create a new tower-arch project. The starfish skeleton served as the basis. And this wonderful building is an example of the use of the principles of the new science of biomimetic (bionics) in architecture. This principle of rationality was used by young French design engineers to create a new tower-arch project to enter the World Exhibition of France. The starfish skeleton served as the basis. And this magnificent building is an example of the use of the principles of the new science of biomimetic (bionics) in architecture. The new building schemes of that time preferred to frighten the commission members rather than attract them with their unusualness.  Bridge the name of the builder Alexander Gustov was known and respected in France, and the names of Nugier and Kehlen did not \"stake\" anything. Eiffel's name may serve as the only key to the realization of his bold plans.  Thus, the information that Alexander Gustov Eiffel used the project of a fictional Arab or people like him \"into darkness\" is unnecessary. We add that Eiffel not only used the project of his engineers, but also made some changes to the drawings using his rich experience in bridge construction and special methods he developed. , which strengthened the structure of the tower and gave it a unique airiness.    These special methods were based on the scientific discovery of Swiss anatomy professor Hermann von Meyer, who documented an interesting discovery 40 years before the construction of the Eiffel Tower: the head of the human femur transfers the load to the bone. covered with a fine network of tiny bones that distribute in a surprising manner. Thanks to this redistribution, the human femur does not break under the weight of the body and withstands huge loads, although it enters the joint at an angle. And this network has a strict geometric structure. In 1866, an engineer-architect from Switzerland, Carl Kuhlmann, a professor of anatomy, summarized the scientific and technical basis of the opening, which Gustav Eiffel used in the construction of bridges - the distribution of loads using curved girders. Later, he used the same method to build a complex structure such as the three hundred meter tower.    So this tower is truly a marvel of 19th century thinking and technology in every way!Who built the Eiffel Tower  So in 1886 Third at the beginning hi The municipality of Paris of the French Republic and Alexandre Gustave Eiffel signed an agreement stating the following agreements:    In 2 years and 6 months, Eiffel had to erect an arch tower opposite the Jena Bridge. The Seine in the Champ de Mars according to the drawings he proposed.  Eiffel will provide the tower for private use for 25 years at the end of construction.  To give Eiffel a cash subsidy of six 1.5 million francs from the city budget for the construction of the tower, which is 7% of the total construction budget. , 25% of 8 million francs.  300 workers for 2 years, 2 months and 5 days, as they say, \\\"without layoffs and holidays\\\" on March 31, 1889 (less than 26 months after the start of construction) they worked hard to work. later, the grand opening ceremony of the greatest building, a symbol of new France, took place.ad  Not only extremely clear and accurate drawings, but also the use of Ural iron helped such an advanced construction. In the 18th and 19th centuries, all of Europe knew the word \\\"Yekaterinburg\\\" because of this metal. Steel was not used in the construction of the tower (carbon content was not more than 2%), but a special iron alloy was melted in Ural furnaces for the iron lady. The Iron Lady is another name for the entrance arch before it was called the Eiffel Tower. However, iron alloys corrode easily, so the tower was painted with a specially prepared bronze paint and took 60 tons. Since then, every 7 years, the Eiffel Tower has been treated and painted with the same \"bronze\" composition, and every 7 years 60 tons of paint were spent on it. The frame of the tower itself weighs 7.3 tons, together with the weight of concrete, the total weight is 10,100 tons! The number of steps was also calculated - 1 thousand 710 pcs. Arch and garden design  The lower part of the ground is in the form of a truncated pyramid with the length of the sides 129.2 m, the columns of the corners extend up and form a high (57.63 m) arch as planned . On this coffered \"ceiling\", the first square platform with a length of about 46 m on each side was fixed, and on this platform several halls of a huge restaurant with huge showcase windows, like on a hoverboard, were restored, from which all 4 of Paris a wonderful view of the side opened. Even then, the view from the tower on the banks of the Seine with the Pont de Jena bridge was amazing. But the dense green massif in Place de Mars - a park with an area of more than 21 hectares - did not exist at that time.ad  The idea of \u200B\u200Breplanning the former parade ground of the Royal Military School in the public park was the brainchild of architect and gardener Jean-Camille Formiget. came only in 1908. It took 20 years to realize these plans! In contrast to the strict framework of the paintings in which the Eiffel Tower was built, the plan of the park has changed a lot. Initially planned in a strictly English style, the park (24 hectares) grew a little during the construction and absorbed the spirit of free France. \"settled\" democratically between tall solid trees and well-defined avenues, abundant flowering bushes and geometrically thin rows. In addition to the village \"reservoirs, English classical fountains. Interesting facts about the construction  The main stage of construction was not the installation of the \\\"metal lace\\\" itself, but about 3 million steel rivet ties used, but guaranteed stability of the base and compliance with the absolutely ideal horizontal level of the building on an area of \u200B\u200B1.6 hectares. It took only 8 months \"with the tail\" to fix the exposed trunks of the tower and give it a round shape, and a year and a half to lay a reliable foundation time has passed. According to the project description, the foundation lies at a depth of less than 5 meters below the level of the Seine River, 100 stone blocks with a thickness of 10 m are laid in the foundation pit, and 16 powerful supports are already installed on these blocks, which are 4 towers \\\" \"legs\" make up the spinal cord. Above it stands the Eiffel Tower. In addition, a hydraulic device is installed on each \"lady\" leg, which allows the \"lady\" to maintain balance and a horizontal position. The lifting capacity of each device is 800 tons. During the installation of the lower floor, an addition was added to the project - 4 elevators to the second platform. Later, another one - the fifth elevator - began to work from the second platform to the third platform. The fifth elevator appeared after the tower was electrified at the beginning of the 20th century. Until now, all 4 elevators worked on hydraulic traction. Interesting facts about the elevators  When the fascist German troops occupied France, the Germans could not hang the spider flag on the top of the tower - for unknown reasons, all the elevators were full suddenly stopped working. And for the next 4 years, they were in this position. The swastika is only a ladder It was installed at the level of the second floor, which reached the floor. The resistance of France bitterly said: \\\"Hitler managed to conquer the country of France, but he could never hit it in the heart!\\\"ad  What else is worth knowing about the tower?  We Eiffel Tower immediately \\\"Heart of Paris\\\" \"We must sincerely admit that it has not become At the beginning of the construction and even during the opening (March 31, 1889), the tower was illuminated with lights (10,000 gas lamps with the colors of the French flag) and several powerful mirror lights that made it great and monumental. Rejection of the extraordinary beauty of the Eiffel Tower. In particular, famous people such as Victor Hugo and Paul Marie Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud and Guy de Maupassant in front of the Paris City Hall saw the \"hateful building of iron and screws stretching across the city\" from the face of the Parisian land. They appealed to the Paris mayor's office, demanding to erase the \"disgusting shadow\". a piece of ink, tormenting the bright streets of Paris with its hideous structure! \\\"An interesting fact: his own signature under this appeal did not prevent Maupassant from becoming a frequent guest of the glass gallery restaurant on the second floor of the tower. Maupassant himself was a \\\"monster in a nut\\\" in this city and \\\" but the great writer was cunning, oh, the great writer was cunning! In fact, Maupassant, being a famous gourmet, ordered oysters cooked and chilled on ice, soft with caraway seeds. could not resist tasting the aromatic soft cheese, steamed young asparagus with a thin slice of dried veal and washing down these \"excesses\" with a glass of light grape wine. of the Eiffel Tower restaurant the kitchen is still full of authentic French cuisine, and the fact that a famous literary critic dined there is a business card of the restaurant.    On the same second floor, there are tanks with machine oil for hydraulic machines. On the third floor, on a rectangular platform, there was enough space for an astronomical and meteorological observatory. And the last small platform, just 1.4 m across, supports the lighthouses, which shine from a height of 300 m. was visible at a distance of 10 km. After replacing gas lamps with electric lamps, lighthouses began to \\\"hit\\\" up to 70 km!ad  Whether French fine art lovers like this \"lady\" or not, for Gustave Eiffel, her unexpected and daring form is morning paid for all his efforts and expenses in less than a year. In just 6 months of the World's Fair, the extraordinary work of the bridge builder attracted 2 million curious people, whose flow did not dry up even after the closure of the exhibition complexes. Later, all the miscalculations made by Gustav and his engineers -the books more than justify themselves: the 8,600-ton tower, made of 12,000 scattered metal parts, not only did not budge when its columns sank almost 1 meter under water during the 1910 flood. and that year it was practically determined that it would not move even with 12,000 people on its 3 floors. In 1910, after this flood, it would be a great sacrifice to destroy the Eiffel Tower, which sheltered so many disadvantaged people. This period was first extended to 70 years, and then, after a complete health check of the Eiffel Tower, it was extended to 100 years.  In 1921, the tower served as a source of radio broadcasts, and from 1935, television broadcasts.  Already in 1957 the tall tower was increased by 12 m by a telemast, and its total \"height\" was 323 m 30 cm.  For a long time, until 1931, the \"iron lace\" of France was the tallest structure in the world, and only New- The construction of the Chrysler Building in York broke this record.  In 1986, the external lighting of this architectural wonder was replaced by a system that illuminates the tower from the inside, making the Eiffel Tower not only dazzling, but truly magical, especially during holidays and at night.   Every year, the heart of Paris, the symbol of France, receives 6 million visitors. Photos taken on its three viewing platforms are a good memory for any tourist. Even the photo next to it is already pride, it is not for nothing that there are small copies of it in many countries of the world. The most interesting tower of Gustave Eiffel is probably located in Belarus, in the village of Paris, Vitebsk region. This tower is only 30 meters high, but it is unique in that it is made entirely of wooden planks.    We recommend looking at Big Ben.    There is also the Eiffel Tower in Russia. Three of them:    Irkutsk. Baland area - 13 m.  Krasnoyarsk. Height - 16 m. Chelyabinsk region, Paris village. It is 50 m tall, owned by a mobile operator and is the real working cell tower in the region.  ad  But the best thing is to get a tourist visa, see Paris and ... No, don't die! And die with pleasure and take a picture of Paris from the Eiffel Tower, fortunately, on a clear day, the city is visible 140 km away.

  "finikiyaliklar_desc":"Phoenicians They were a people of Semitic origin who lived mainly on the coasts of present-day Syria, Palestine, Israel and Lebanon from the twelfth century BC. Although C. Herodotus confirmed that they came from the Indian Ocean, he does not have much information about their origin.    Phoenicia, the area where they lived, was also known as Canaan. That is why the Phoenicians called themselves Canaanites. This people never formed a unified union, but founded a number of city-states, from which Sidon or Tire were separated. Each of them was ruled by a monarchy and a council made up of the richest families. The Phoenicians were very seafaring and commercial people. Their ships sailed in the large part of the Mediterranean Sea, exchanging goods. Similarly, they founded colonies of various kinds that stretched from North Africa to the south of the Iberian Peninsula. Phoenicians' control over the Mediterranean began to wane from 333 BC. C., when the great empires of that time, Assyria and Persia, occupied their territories. However, one of its most important colonies, Carthage, survived and became one of Rome's great rivals.    Phoenicians Origin and History These people were of Semitic origin, probably coming from the Persian Gulf coast. Its members called themselves Canaanites or Children of Canaan, the name of the region they inhabited in the Mediterranean Levant. despite the existence of ignorance, it is known that they lived here in the II millennium BC.

The remains of Byblos, one of the first important cities, date back to 2700 BC. S    The area of Canaan has been inhabited since 10,000 BC. C. by groups engaged in fishing, hunting and farming.    During the Bronze Age, from 3200 BC. C., the cities of the region began to have great organizational complexity. One such place was Byblos, which was the first important city-state of Phoenicia and had strong trade relations with Egypt.    From 1800 onwards. C., the Egyptians gained power and invaded the territory dominated by the Phoenicians. This occupation lasted until 1100 BC. The city of Sidon became the most powerful city in Phoenicia. As a major maritime and commercial center of the region, it was the origin of many ships that passed through the eastern coast of the Mediterranean.    His ships traded goods to Cyprus, Asia Minor, Greece, Rhodes, the Aegean Islands, and the Black Sea coast. .    Sidon did not succeed in establishing colonies, although they established some concessions in countries they considered civilized and factories in barbarism. In the second, they received slaves, metals, and hides in exchange for manufactured goods.    This phase ended with the Philistine attack on Sidon in the 12th century BC. C. It was succeeded by Tyre.    Shine period (12th - 7th centuries BC)  The city of Tire inherited the trade hegemony previously exercised by Sidon. In his work, he expanded his trade networks to Western Europe, including southern Italy, Malta, Sardinia, Sicily, Corsica, southern Spain, and northern Africa. On their travels, they came to pass through the Strait of Gibraltar.    On the other hand, they also reached the shores of England, the Azores and the Canary Islands. The Tyrians were not only limited to establishing commercial relations, but also established many colonies in strategic places. founded.    Their hegemony came to an end when the Chaldeans, Persians, and Assyrians defeated them militarily. In its place, other trading cities appeared, such as Carthage, one of the Phoenician colonies.    The Carthaginian period (9th - 2nd centuries BC) After the decline of Tyre, Carthage became one of the most prosperous cities in the entire Mediterranean. turned. This former Phoenician colony gained commercial dominance that stretched from Sicily to the coast of Spain.    At this time, the Phoenician region was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus II in 538 BC. This occupation lasted until 345 BC. When the Phoenicians rebelled against their rulers C. However, because the Persians had taken over their territory  li, the freedom was short-lived.    Finally, the ancient territory ruled by the Phoenicians was conquered in 322 BC. by Alexander the Great.    The Carthaginians continued their trade hegemony for another two centuries, until they were defeated by the Romans in the so-called Punic Wars. Carthage was destroyed in 146 BC. S    Characteristics of the Phoenicians  The Phoenicians had a continuous presence in the Mediterranean Levant for almost 3,000 years. Historians have identified several expressions of their culture:    - Canaanite Phoenicians (3300 to 330 BC)  - Western Phoenicians (1200 BC to 46 BC): Phoenicians, Punics, Libyan-Phoenicians or Carthaginians  - Greco-Roman Phoenicians (from 330 BC to 395 AD).  - Byzantine Phoenicians (from 395 to 636 AD) This town is considered very peaceful. Their main interests were trade and they were able to interact with other cultures.    Denomination The area occupied by the Phoenicians was known as Canaan. For this reason they called themselves Canaanites (bin kenan, \"Sons of Canaan\"). However, other cities gave them different names. For example, the ancient Greeks called them fonilkes (purple or red), probably because of the dyes of this color that they sold. The term comes from the Greek word poenus, Punic where.    Political Organization  The Phoenicians never formed a unified state. Instead, they created a series of city-states with varying degrees of wealth and political power. Throughout its history, the most important city of each moment exercised a certain general political leadership.    These cities were independent of each other. Their domains were very small, although they always had enough resources to support their population.    An exception due to its military character was Carthage. However, their armed invasion was not intended to establish political power, but commercial dominance.    The city-states were ruled by a king from the most desirable social classes. The monarch's power was not absolute, as he had to share it with a council of elders consisting of members of the 100 richest merchant families.    Phoenician Culture  Although the Phoenicians had great commercial importance, their culture almost no information. Information about this town comes mainly from documents and stories of other towns in the area, as well as the remains of their temples and works of art.    The Phoenicians are not considered the creators of their own cultural tradition. Instead, they served as bridges between different cultures and encouraged their diffusion and mixing.    His main legacy was the invention of the phonetic alphabet, which was later adapted by the Greeks and became the basis for the Western alphabets. was.    Art  Phoenician architecture used local stone as the main material. Their houses, tombs and temples were built with this type of stone or with limestone.    Their houses had open structures and a rectangular plan. The cities were fortified and contained interconnected residential buildings.    On the other hand, their art was handmade and focused mainly on commercial exchange. Its influence reached cultures such as Assyria, Syria or Egypt. Its artisans had a taste for these places to create their works and knew very well that they were more valued.    Coloniality  One of the most important features of Phoenician culture was its colonial activity. This was all about trade as the Phoenicians sought to expand their trade network across the Mediterranean.    This city used three different colonial systems:    Advantages: Phoenicians were located in a neighborhood or city with a civilized country they conducted negotiations to have the opportunity to live in the place. There they established their markets, markets and warehouses.  Factories: it is located in the barbarian countries. They were strong bases devoted to barter.  Colonies: these cities or settlements were located in foreign territories and were supposed to be loyal to the Phoenicians. Among the most famous were Hades in North Africa (now Cadiz, Spain), Malaga (also in Spain) or Carthage. Geographical location of the Phoenicians The Phoenicians settled in Asia Minor, along the Mediterranean Sea and in the western part of Syria. Most of its territory is located in present-day Lebanon.    This territory consisted of a narrow strip 50 kilometers wide and 200 kilometers long. It borders Syria from the north soup; in the south with Palestine (Mount Carmel); on the east by the mountains of Lebanon; and to the south by the Mediterranean Sea.    It was a rugged land full of small beaches, making it very difficult to develop agriculture. However, there were many ports, such as Byblos, Sidon, Tire or Arad, which favored this maritime trade. The forests that existed in the area provided them with the wood they needed to build their boats.    Society  Phoenician society was governed by hereditary monarchies, in which the king also assumed priestly duties. However, his power was not absolute, as he shared it with a council of elders.    High officials included Azob, a judge who held important functions in the western colonies.    Monarchs increasingly assumed roles outside of their religious roles. had to maintain a balance between a growing commercial oligarchy and a traditional aristocracy associated with agriculture.

Social Structure  The Phoenician social pyramid was ruled by a king, although he had to share power with a council of elders.    The Second Stage There were nobles belonging to the founding families of the city. They usually held important administrative positions, and most of them belonged to commercial companies.    Merchants were practically on the same level as nobles, given the importance of their activities to the city.    The next social class consisted of artisans and farmers. The former were responsible for the production of raw materials received by merchants. The products were then sold in markets across the Mediterranean.    The final step was taken by slaves. Many came from commercial exchanges and worked in the homes of the wealthiest or in temples.    Economy  The most important economic activity among the Phoenicians was trade, which was the real backbone of their society.    Agricultural land was scarce, although when it produced enough for food and even had a surplus used in trade.    Religion    Phoenician religion had many gods. These are for other cities, such as Baal, Dagon, or Astarte, which are common to all cities and are worshiped in only one place. Some of their gods were the basis for some of what the ancient Greeks worshipped.  Among their religious practices was the obligation of women to offer their virginity to the priests of the Temple of Ashtart. They also performed sacrifices for children.    Major Gods  Astarte began as the main goddess of Sidon, and later her presence spread to other Phoenician cities. She was the goddess of fertility, although depending on the city she was considered a patron goddess of war, hunting, or sailors.    Another common deity was Baal, associated with the Sun. This god was worshiped by various peoples of Asia Minor and Phoenicians such as the Chaldeans, Philistines or Babylonians.    Baal is the god of war and rain and appears in the Bible as one of the false gods worshiped at that time.  \\ nReshef, who had a warlike character and was associated with the kulfates, was associated with Astarte and was highly worshiped in Egypt during the reign of Amenophis II.    Among the common deities, the cult of Melkarth, born in Tyre, was prominent. It was originally an agricultural deity associated with fertility and associated with spring. His worship included death and resurrection rituals that corresponded to the seasons. Melkarth was also a god of the sea, and over time became a colonial deity and a guide to sea travel.\\ n  Other Gods  Baal's wife, Anat, was worshiped as a goddess of fertility and war. Some experts associate him with Athena, and the Egyptians are known to have worshiped him.    The bloodiest god among the Phoenicians was Moloch. It is depicted with the head of a bull and the body of a man. In an annual ritual, sacrifices were made to this deity: a group of young people wrapped around a hollow statue representing the deity and then burned alive.    Language and writing The language spoken by the Phoenician people was Semitic, a subgroup of the Kanites. . The language of Tire and Sidon to Phoenicia spread over n parts. Throughout the history of this city, there were many options. Among them, the term Punic was called the western varieties of Phoenicia of the 4th century BC. S    According to experts, Phoenician was a language with similarities to ancient Hebrew and Amorite. The 22 consonant graphemes of the Phoenician alphabet were later inherited directly by the Hebrews. some comments have been restored.    One of these finds is Cippi de Melqart, found in Malta in 1694. Their inscriptions are found in ancient Greek and Punic languages, which allowed the French Abbe Barthelemy to decipher the text. In the same year, a trade agreement signed by the Etruscans and the Phoenicians appeared.",

  "iso_haykali": "Statue of Jesus",
  "iso_haykali_desc": "The statue of Christ the Redeemer is not only a landmark in Rio de Janeiro, but it is also the pride of Brazil and one of the most famous Christian symbols in the world. Millions of tourists dream of seeing one of the modern wonders of the world, but often they choose the time of the carnival to visit this city. If there is a desire to enjoy the beauty and spirituality of the monument, it is better to choose a quieter time, but, in any case, it will not work to wait for the complete absence of visitors. Stages of construction of the statue of Christ the Redeemer  The idea of creating a unique statue as a symbol of Christianity first appeared in the 16th century, but then there were no opportunities to implement such a global project. Later, in the late 1880s, construction began on a railroad to the top of Corcovado Mountain. Without him, the project would have been difficult to implement, as heavy elements, building materials and equipment had to be transported during the construction of the statue. In 1921, Brazil was preparing to celebrate the centenary of independence, which gave rise to the idea of \u200B\u200Binstalling a statue of Christ the Redeemer on top of the mountain. The new monument was supposed to become an important element of the capital, as well as attract tourists to the observation deck, from which the whole city could be seen. \"Cruzeiro\" magazine, which organized a subscription to the construction of the monument, was involved in raising money. As a result of the collection, it was possible to pledge more than two million flights. The church did not stand aside: the archbishop of the city, Don Sebastian Leme, allocated a large sum of money from the donations of the parishioners for the construction of the statue of Jesus.    The total period for the creation and installation of Christ the Redeemer was nine years. The original project belongs to the artist Carlos Oswald. According to him, Christ should have stood on a pedestal in the form of a globe with outstretched arms. The revised version of the sketch is attributed to the hand of the engineer Eitor da Silva Costa, who changed the shape of the pedestal. This is how the famous Christian monument can be seen today. Due to the lack of technological development, most of the elements were produced in France. The finished parts were delivered to Brazil, after which they were transported by rail to the top of Corcovodo. In October 1931, the statue was illuminated during a ceremony. Since then, it has become a well-known symbol of the city.    Description of the construction of the monument  A reinforced concrete structure was used as a frame for the statue of Christ the Redeemer, the monument itself is made of soapstone, there are glass elements. The artistic feature is the giant pose. Christ stands with outstretched hands, on the one hand, determining forgiveness for all, and on the other, the blessing of people. This position of the body from a distance resembles a cross - the main symbol of the Christian faith. The monument cannot be classified as the tallest in the world, but at the same time it is impressive because it is located on the top of a mountain. Its absolute height is 38 meters, eight of which are at the base. The entire structure weighs about 630 tons. Another feature of the statue is that it is illuminated at night, which significantly increases the impact of the monument's spiritual significance for all believers. The rays are directed at Christ in such a way that it seems as if he is coming down from a vast sky to bless his children. The spectacle is truly impressive and deserves everyone's attention, so even at night there are not a lot of tourists in Rio de Janeiro. On the most important days, services were held at the base of the monument. The re-illumination took place in 1965, when Pope Paul VI received the honor. On the fiftieth anniversary of the opening of the monument, the highest representatives of the Christian Church took part in the solemn ceremony. The Russian Orthodox Church has long avoided this important thing for the Christian monument, but in 2007, the first divine service was held near the pedestal. During this period, the days of Russian culture were established in Latin America, which caused the arrival of many famous people, including church hierarchs. In February of last year, Patriarch Kirill together with the spiritual choir of the Moscow Diocese held a Christian support service. April 16, 2010 became an unpleasant page in the history of the monument, because on this day, for the first time, an act of vandalism was committed against the spiritual symbol. The face and hands of Jesus Christ are covered with black paint. It was not possible to determine the reasons for these actions, and all entries were removed as soon as possible. Interesting facts about the statue  Famous given the location of the monument, it is not surprising that it would become an ideal target for lightning. According to statistics, the statue takes at least four hits every year. Some injuries appear to be so severe that reconstructive measures are necessary. For these purposes, the local diocese has an impressive stock of giants created.ad  Tourists visiting the city of Brazil can visit the statue of Christ the Redeemer in two ways. Small electric trains run to the foot of the monument, so you can get acquainted with the road that was laid in the 19th century, and then see one of the new wonders of the world. There is also a highway that passes through the largest forest area within the city limits. Photos from Tijuca National Park will also complement the collection of pictures about travel to Brazil",

Roman settlement in Spain lasted until the 7th century, but most of their settlements were taken by the Visigoths in the 5th century. In 711, Moors from North Africa invaded Spain and pushed the Visigoths north. The Moors remained in the region until 1492, despite several attempts to push them out.    Present-day Spain was annexed by the US Department of State until 1512.

In 1953, Spain signed a Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement with the United States and joined the United Nations in 1955.    These international partnerships eventually allowed the Spanish economy to begin to grow, as until then it was the largest in Europe and the world. closed. In the 1960s and 1970s, Spain created a modern economy and in the late 1970s began a transition to a more democratic government.

  "jahon_urushlari": "World wars",
  "jahon_urushlari_desc": "A world war is an international conflict involving all or many of the world's major powers[1]. Traditionally, the term has been reserved for the two major international conflicts of the first half of the 20th century, World War I (1914â1918) and World War II (1939â1945), although historians have also described other global conflicts as world wars, such as the Nine Years war, the War of the Spanish Succession, the Seven Years' War, the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, the Cold War, and the War on Terror.    Etymology  The Oxford English Dictionary cites the first known use of the term world war in English in 1848 for the Scottish newspaper The People's Journal: \"A war between great powers is definitely a world war.\" The term \"World War\" was used by Karl Marx and his partner Friedrich Engels[2] in a series of articles entitled \"The Class Struggles in France\" published in 1850. In 1889, Rasmus B. Anderson described the episode in Teutonic mythology as a \"world war\" (Swedish: vÃ¤rdskrig), based on the line from the Old Norse epic \"VÃ¶luspÃ¡: folcvig fyrst I heimi\" (\"The first great war in the world\"). German author August Wilhelm Otto Niemann's anti-British novel Der Weltkrieg: Deutsche TrÃ¤ume (The Coming Conquest of England) published in English in 1904 as \"The Coming Conquest of England\" \" had used the term.    The term \"World War I\" was first used in September 1914 by the German biologist and philosopher Ernst Haeckel, who quoted a wire service report from The Indianapolis Star on September 20, 1914: \"There is no doubt about the course and character of the terrible European war ... it will turn into the first world war in the full sense of the word\" [3], he noted. In English, the term \"World War I\" was used by Lt. Col. Charles Ã  Court Repington as the title of his memoirs (published in 1920), in which, in a diary entry dated September 10, 1918, he recorded a discussion on the subject with Major Johnstone of Harvard University[ 4].    The term \"World War I\" was coined by Time magazine on June 12, 1939, page 28b. On page 32 of the same article, \"World War II\" was first used speculatively to describe an impending war. The term was first used to describe actual warfare in the September 11, 1939, issue. A week ago, on September 4th, the day after France and Great Britain declared war on Germany, the Danish newspaper Kristeligt Dagblad reported on its front page that \"World War II began at 11:00 yesterday morning\".[5] Speculative. fiction writers first noted the concept of World War II in the 1919s and 1920s when Milo Hastings wrote his dystopian novel City of Endless Night. in French: \"world war\" is translated as guerre mondiale, in German: Weltkrieg (before the war, used in the abstract sense of a global conflict), in Italian: guerra mondiale, in Spanish and Portuguese: guerra mundial, from and in Norwegian: world war, in Russian : Ð¼Ð¸ÑÐ¾Ð²Ð°Ñ Ð²Ð¾Ð¹Ð½Ð° (Ð¼Ð¸ÑÐ¾Ð²Ð°Ñ Ð²Ð¾Ð¹Ð½Ð°) and in Finnish: maailmansota.    World War I  World War I lasted from 1914 to 1918. From the perspective of human technological history, the expansion of the scope of world war was facilitated by the technological advances of the second industrial revolution, global power projection, and globalization, which allowed for the mass production of military equipment. It was recognized that the complex system of opposing military alliances (the German and Austro-Hungarian empires against the British, Russian, and French empires) could lead to a worldwide conflict if war broke out. A very small skirmish between these two countries led to a world war. The fact that the warring powers had large overseas empires almost guaranteed that such a war would be worldwide, as the resources of the colonies would be a decisive strategic factor in the war. The same strategic considerations ensured that belligerents attacked each other's colonies, thus making wars far more widespread than in pre-Columbian times.    War crimes were committed in World War I. Although the Hague Conventions of 1889 and 1907 prohibited the use of chemical weapons in warfare, such weapons were used in World War I. The Ottoman Empire was responsible for the Armenian Genocide during World War I. World War II World War II lasted from 1939 to 1945. is the only conflict in which nuclear weapons were used; Both Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the Empire of Japan were destroyed by atomic bombs dropped by the United States. Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler was responsible for genocides, particularly the Holocaust, in which approximately 6,000,000 Jews and 11,000,000 people of other religions were persecuted by the Nazis, including the killing of Romani people and homosexuals.[6] The United States, the Soviet Union, and Canada deported minority groups of Germans within their borders, and many ethnic Germans were subsequently expelled from Eastern Europe as a result of the conflict. Japan attacked neutral countries like Pearl Harbor without declaring war. He also gained notoriety for his brutal treatment and killing of Allied prisoners of war and Asian civilians. Also, Japan used Asians for forced labor and 250,000 civilians were brutally killed by Japanese troops in the Nanking Massacre.    The outcome of the war had a major impact on world history. Ancient European empires fell or disintegrated as a direct result of the costs of war, and in some cases the defeat of the imperial forces caused their collapse. The United States firmly established itself as the dominant global superpower in competition with its ideological enemy, the Soviet Union. The two superpowers exerted political influence over most of the world's nation-states for decades after the end of World War II. The modern international security, economic and diplomatic system in these lands was created as a result of wars[7]. Institutions such as the United Nations were established to collectivize international relations, and their clear goal is to prevent another general war. Wars also changed everyday life. Technologies developed during wartime have also had a major impact on civilian life, such as the development of jet aircraft, penicillin, atomic energy, and electronic computers.    Potential World War III  Since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II, the potential for nuclear weapons has Fears of World War III are widespread and long-standing. It was often predicted that it would escalate into a nuclear war, and that it would be more destructive and violent than World Wars I and II. Albert Einstein said in 1947: \"I don't know what weapons World War III will be fought with, but World War Four will be fought with sticks and stones\".[8][9][10][11] Various former government officials, politicians, authors, and military leaders (including James Woolsey[12], Alexandre de Marenches[13], Eliot Cohen[14] and Subcomandante Marcos[15]) on various past wars since the end of World War II and current global wars , for example, applied the names \"World War III\" and \"World War IV\" to the Cold War and the War on Terror. However, none of the wars are generally considered to be at the level of a world war.    In the early 21st century, the war in Afghanistan (2001â2021), the Arab Spring (2010â2012), the Syrian Civil War (2011âpresent), the war in Iraq (2013â2017) ), the Russia-Ukraine War (2014âpresent), the Yemeni Civil War (2014âpresent), the 2022 Kazakhstan riots, and their global spread are sometimes described as proxy wars waged by the United States and Russia.[16][17][18] [19] [20]. According to Holger H. Herwig, there have been eight world wars so far. Although this assumption is far from the truth, of the wars mentioned, all but the Seven Years' War: the Nine Years' War, followed by the War of the Spanish Succession, the War of the Austrian Succession, the Napoleonic Wars, World War I, and World War IIâwere officially called world wars. [23].    Another example worthy of the name is the Second Congo War (1998â2003), which involved nine countries and resulted in low-intensity warfare that continues despite an official peace and the first democratic elections in 2006. Although the war was fought on only one continent, it is often referred to as the \"African World War\".",

It is known that Ancient Rome gave the modern world a lot of monuments, architectural monuments and structures. Among them, undoubtedly, is the Colosseum amphitheater, which is famous for its size and majesty. The Colosseum, built in the 1st century BC, is in the form of an amphitheater and is located one and a half kilometers southeast of the Pantheon. However, the identity of the architect who built it is not found in any historical documents. It is known that the construction of the building was started by order of the emperor Vespasiana and was completed by his son Titus Flavius in 80. The amphitheater built over the artificial lake was named Flavians from the beginning. But, for some reason, the name of the building Colosseum is popular among the public. To some extent, the reason for its name is the huge statue of Emperor Nero. After all, the word \"colosseum\" means \"giant\". There were many amphitheaters in ancient Rome. However, none of them could match the Colosseum. This is because the Colosseum was very different from the typical Greek amphitheatres built on hills. The Colosseum was built as a separate building on the plain. At that time, the elliptical structure was 189 meters long and 156 meters wide, and occupied an area of 24,000 square meters. The amphitheater walls, which were 48 meters high and 545 meters along the perimeter, were built of limestone blocks. Such blocks are attached to each other with the help of iron levers. The northern facade of the Colosseum consists of a three-winged arch, and four main corridors lead to the amphitheater stage. In just 10 minutes, the audience went to the numbered seats. The Colosseum can accommodate more than 50,000 people on average. Entrance to the amphitheater was absolutely free. Everyone who entered the amphitheater was treated with bread. That's why some people used to spend the night here. After all, the main purpose of holding games in the Colosseum was to win the hearts of the people and increase people's trust in the emperor. The Colosseum was able to fulfill such a task. Spectators flocked here. Especially women were avid fans of such spectacles.  Colosseum seats were arranged by sectors and numbers as they are today. The audience is stratified by origin. For example, in the amphitheater there was a special compartment and a seat reserved for the emperor. From the rows after him, his relatives occupied a place. In the top rows of the Colosseum, there are slaves who control the elevator. The number of such elevators was 36 at that time. The upper rows were reserved for sailors of the Imperial Navy, who were responsible for the timely removal of the huge gray cloth that protected the amphitheater from the rain. This fabric, which has the function of a unique tim, is stretched on 240 poles with the help of ropes. Today, these columns are hard to find in the Colosseum. However, it still has its place on the walls of the amphitheater. In addition, the Colosseum had its own underground structure. Wild animals were kept in existing cages there. Gladiators were preparing for battle in the corridors. In addition, these constructions made it possible to conduct water fights, which were extremely difficult at the time. During this time, about 5,000 wild animals brought from Africa and hundreds of gladiators were killed. At first, only captured warriors and those condemned to death participated in the famous gladiator fight. According to ancient Roman law, a person who won a battle (received a monetary reward) had the right to buy his life. However, later, participation in these games is considered an honor, and people who have given up their will also start participating in them. Even women expressed a desire to compete with dwarfs.  By 405, Emperor Honorius banned gladiatorial combat. However, animal sacrifice continues in the Colosseum until the 6th century. In the Middle Ages, the Roman Coliseum served as a fortress for the upper class. Later, the amphitheater will be turned into a venue for public events. According to some sources, in the 14th century, bullfights were often held in the Coliseum. However, in the middle of that century, Rome suffered a severe earthquake. From that time on, the Colosseum was turned into a site of construction materials. A certain part of the building's wall was demolished, and its bricks are used to build churches. Until the end of the 19th century, the Colosseum was used by the priests as a temple for religious ceremonies.  However, the Roman Colosseum was even today, he has not lost his strength and majesty. Today, the building has been partially renovated. Although it cannot be brought back to its former state, it is possible to preserve and watch it as much as possible. After all, the Colosseum remains the rarest work of Roman architecture, its symbol.",

The earliest history  Archaeological findings show that intelligent people, Homo Sapines, lived in the Korean Peninsula about 40-30 thousand years ago. appeared. In Hamgyongbukdo, Pyongannamdo, Gyeonggido and Chungcheong-bukdo provinces, many stone tools from the Paleolithic period were found. People of those years lived in caves, built primitive houses, engaged in hunting and gathering.    The oldest examples of pottery on the Korean Peninsula date back to 8000 BC. Pottery from 3500-2000 BC (\"Chilmun Ceramics\" (Korean: jeulmuntogi)) has been found in all parts of the peninsula, and ceramics can also be found in Primorsky Krai, Mongolia, and Manchuria. Chilmun ceramics are very similar to Jomon ceramics of the same period in Japan in their main characteristics.    Ancient Choson  According to legend, the first Korean state was founded in 2333 BC by the son of the heavenly Tangun. Historians call the earliest stage of Korean history the Ancient Choson (Ko Joseon) period. The ancient Joseon region is located in the north of the Korean Peninsula and the Liaodong Peninsula. Many modern historians believe that 2333 BC is too old, as this date is not supported by any historical documents other than isolated medieval Korean chronicles (Samguk Yusa, etc.). The first records of ancient Choson date back to the 4th and 3rd centuries BC.[1] At the beginning of its development, ancient Choson was a tribal confederation consisting of separately governed city-states, which became a centralized state in the IV century BC. Around this time, the Chin state and the Trikhan states were formed in the south of the peninsula. In 108 BC, Ancient Choson was subjugated by the Chinese Han Empire.    Early states (108 BC)- III century )    Tomb in Goguryeo  After the ancient Choson state, three tribal confederations were formed in the peninsula. These were: Makhan, Chinhan, and Pyonghan (collective name of Uchkhanlik i.e. Samhan) were tribal confederations. In the north of Samhan, the state of Buyeo (Fuyu) developed. Also, several small states emerged in the former Joseon territory, including Okjo and Dongye (Eastern Ye).    The Three Kingdoms    Costumes of Korean rulers during the Three Kingdoms period  Three early feudal lords from tribal confederations after the breakup of the Joseon state at the beginning of our era state - the states of Silla, Baekje and Goguryeo were formed.    United Silla and Bohai (Northern and Southern Dynasties)    King and Queen of the Silla State  In 676, after the conquest of the Goguryeo and Baekje states, the United Silla State was formed, its in 935, the state of Goryeo (918-1392) was established instead.    At the same time, the state of Bohai developed in the north.    This period in Korean history is marked by the rise of Buddhism.    The Last Three Kingdoms  During the Last Three Kingdoms (892â936) There were three states on the Korean peninsula: Silla, Baekje, and Goguryeo (changed to Majinga in 904 and Taebong in 911). was, occupied the lands of the Silla state in 935 and existed until the restoration of the Choson dynasty in 1392[2]. The name \\\"Goryeo\\\" is an abbreviation of Goguryeo, one of the three original feudal states of Korea unified by Silla in 668 [3] [4] . The modern word \"Korea\" is derived from \"Koryo\".[5] The most famous achievements of the state include the art of Koryo pottery and the Korean tripitaka - the Buddhist canon ( Tripitaka ), engraved on tens of thousands of wooden boards[6]. In 1234, the world's first metal printing matrix was created in Koryo (see Figure 2).[7][8][9] . The Koryo era is considered the \"golden era of Buddhism\" in Korea. In the 11th century, there were about 70 Buddhist temples in the capital alone [3] . Trade with merchants from the Middle East also developed. .    Starting in 993, Koryo faced many invasions from the Liao Dynasty. After the military victory in 1019, an era of peace and prosperity began in Koryo, and Koryo entered its golden age [3] . During this period, the balance of power between the Koryo, Liao, and Song [3] [10] states was maintained in East Asia.",

  "machu_pikchu_desc": "Machu Picchu (pronounced: Machu Picchu) was built in the 15th century and is located in the Eastern Cordillera (2,430m) mountain range of Southern Peru.[1] The historical monument is located 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of the Sacred Valley, above Machupicchu District, Urubamba Province. The Urubamba River cuts through the Cordillera next to it, creating a Canyon with a tropical mountain climate.      Machu Picchu Historic Site in Peru  For most English or Spanish speakers, the first letter \"c\" in Picchu is almost unpronounceable. In English, the name is pronounced as /ËmÉËtÊuË ËpiËtÊuË/ or /ËmÃ¦tÊuË ËpiËktÊuË/[2], in Spanish as [ËmatÊu ËpitÊuÊ] or [ËmatÊu ËpitÊuÊ] or [ËmatÊu ËpitÊuÊ] ([ËumatÊuÊ] and [ËmatÊe]). In the Uzbek and Russian languages, it is customary to call it Machu Picchu.    Unlike the Mayans, the Incas did not have a written language, and it is known that no Europeans visited this place until the 19th century. written sources are almost non-existent. The names of the buildings, their supposed uses, and their inhabitants are the product of modern archaeologists based on physical evidence, including tombs at the site.    Founded by the Incas around 1440 and completed in 1532 The city, suddenly deserted, was neglected for a long time. Due to the erosion of mountain winds and overgrowth, the city gradually disappeared. In 1911, Hiram Bingham, an American historian and scholar, visited the city. will come by chance.    On July 7, 2007, Machu Picchu will be recognized as one of the new seven wonders of the world. On July 13, the President of Peru, Alan GarcÃ­a, will sign a decree to celebrate this day as a holiday.    Today, Machu Picchu is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world: you can get here by train from Cusco, it takes about three hours. However, there are those who want to climb the mountain on foot. It takes several days to climb the Inca Trail[3].    Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historical Reserve in 1981 and was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1983. In 2007, Machu Picchu was recognized as one of the Seven Wonders of the New World in a worldwide internet poll[4].    Etymology  The word machu means \"old man\" or \"old man\" in the Quechua language, while pikchu means \"crushed part of coca\". \" or \"pyramid; means \"pointed, multifaceted hard cone\" [5]. Thus, the name of the monument is sometimes interpreted as \"old mountain\". The monument is located on a narrow saddle between two mountain peaks: Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu.    History    Machu Picchu, Peru  Machu Picchu (according to Richard L. Burger, professor of anthropology at Yale University) is believed to have been built in the 1450s. [6]. However, in 2021, researchers led by Richard Burger used radiocarbon dating (specifically AMS) to determine that Machu Picchu may have been built between 1420 and 1530 AD.[7] Construction was started by two great Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438-1471) and Tupac Inca Yupanqui (1472-1493). There is a consensus among archaeologists that Pachacutec ordered its construction. It may also have been built as a royal estate to be used as a retreat after a successful military campaign. Although Machu Picchu is considered \"royal\" property, it has not been distributed among heirs. Rather, it was used by residents for 80 years before it was abandoned. In other parts of the Inca Empire, the area was neglected due to Spanish occupation. It is possible that most of its inhabitants died of smallpox brought by travelers before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area.    Geographical location    Machu Picchu - Peru  Machu Picchu is located in the southern hemisphere, 13,111 degrees south of the equator. It is located 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco, on top of Machu Picchu, at an elevation of about 2,430 meters (7,970 ft) above mean sea level, 1,000 meters (3,300 ft) below Cusco. Thus, it had a warmer climate than the Inca capital. It is one of the most important archaeological sites in South America and one of the most visited tourist destinations in Latin America, including Peru.[8]    Machu Picchu has wet summers and dry, cold winters, with most of the annual rain falling between October and March. .    Machu Picchu is located on an arc of the Urubamba River that surrounds the monument on three sides, where the cliffs drop 450 meters (1,480 ft) vertically into the river. The area will be covered with fog from the river in the morning. The location of the city is a military secret b, its deep ravines and steep mountains provide natural protection. The Inca Bridge, an Inca grass rope bridge across the Urubamba River at Pongo de Mainique, provided a secret entrance for the Inca army. Another Inca bridge is west of Machu Picchu, made of logs, and built over a 6 meter (20 ft) gap in the rock.    The city sits on a saddle between the mountains of Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu, with the spectacular view of the two valleys behind it. the landscape and the almost impenetrable mountain landscape will be magnificent. It is supplied with water by springs that have not dried up for many years. The hills leading up to it were terraced so that they had more rural areas for growing crops and were higher than the slopes that invaders could climb. Terraces reduce soil erosion and protect against landslides. Machu Picchu's two towering towers cross the mountains towards Cusco, one with entrances via the Sun Gate and the other via the Inca Bridge. Both routes could easily be blocked if the invaders approached the buildings.    Tourism    Machu Picchu tour organized in December 2016  Machu Picchu is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, both cultural and natural. Since its rediscovery in 1911, the number of tourists has been increasing every year, reaching over 1.4 million in 2017. It is also recognized as Peru's most visited tourist attraction and main income generating area. In the late 1990s, the Peruvian government introduced numerous concessions allowing the construction of a cable car and a luxury hotel, including a tourist complex with boutiques and restaurants, as well as a bridge to the site.[9] Many people, including Peruvians and foreign scholars, as well as many visitors, protested the plans, saying the new buildings would add physical weight to the ruins. In 2018, plans were revived to build another cable car to encourage Peruvians to visit Machu Picchu and promote domestic tourism. There is a no-fly zone above the area. UNESCO is considering listing Machu Picchu as a World Heritage in Danger.    In the 1980s, a large stone in Machu Picchu's central square was moved to make way for a helicopter landing zone. In the 1990s, the government banned helicopter landings. In 2006, the Cusco-based company Helicusco tried to get permission to operate tourist flights over Machu Picchu. As a result, the license was soon revoked.    Tourist deaths are usually related to fear of heights, flash floods, and hiking accidents. UNESCO has come under fire for allowing tourists to hike in a place where there is a high risk of injury due to landslides, earthquakes and decaying structures.    In 2014, nude tourism became a trend at Machu Picchu, and Peru's Ministry of Culture condemned the activity. Cusco's Regional Director of Culture stepped up surveillance to end the practice.[10]    From 1994 to 2019, the head of the Machu Picchu National Archaeological Park was Peruvian anthropologist and archaeologist Fernando Astete, who has worked on the preservation and research of the monument for more than three decades. came As a result of his research as park director, the construction processes and functions of the reserve have been recognized by the scientific community and have led to a better understanding of the Inca landscape to the general public. Now they are increasingly practicing sustainable tourism.",
  "mesopotamiya_tarixi": "History of Mesopotamia",
  "mesopotamiya_tarixi_desc": "History of Ancient Mesopotamia  Mesopotamia is the region of the Middle East located between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. Actually, this word itself means \"between two rivers\". This region is of great historical importance because it is where agriculture began, the first cities were founded, and the first civilizations emerged. Historians note that civilization in Mesopotamia began around 5000 BC, but some authors claim it was as early as 3500 BC. Its territory can be divided into two regions: Upper Mesopotamia, inhabited by the Assyrians, and Lower Mesopotamia, inhabited by the Sumerians and Chaldeans[1].      Enkidu, a friend of Gilgamesh, the ruler of the city of Uruk. was full of wars between The last invasion by the Persians has been used by historians to explain the decline of the peoples of the region. In addition to being the birthplace of civilization, Mesopotamia also saw many technical and political innovations. Among the most notable are the wheel, an irrigation system, and the first sets of laws or writings.    Origin and History  The land near the Tigris and Euphrates rivers was ideal for cultivation. Every year the rivers overflowed and increased their fertility. However, there is a huge problem in the region: lack of rain. This means that agriculture was not possible until the people of the region learned how to manage the flow of water[2]. Although the dates are disputed, historians claim that the first agricultural communities settled in the north of the region around 7000 BC. In turn, in the south they did not appear until 5500 BC. In the past, the people of Sumer in the southern part of Mesopotamia began to build irrigation canals, dams and ponds. Thanks to these infrastructures, they were able to grow many products and the population increased significantly. Historians divide the history of Mesopotamia into five periods, five different empires: Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian Empires.    El Obid period (5500-4000 BC)  It is known that the first settlements of this period appeared in 5000 BC started to happen. Permanent settlements appeared about 500 years later. During this period, some nomadic peoples came here from the Zagros Mountains. Settlements grew larger and social organization changed to accommodate the population. One of the most important cities of this period was the city that gave it its name: the city of Obid. The remains found prove that the houses were built with baked clay bricks. In the same way, the first religious buildings were built in the cities during this phase. Considering their flat shape and rectangular plan, experts say that they are the earliest appearance of ziggurots. Another characteristic of this period was the development of irrigation techniques, especially irrigation canals.    The Sumerians  The first great Mesopotamian civilization was Sumer. This town was founded in 3000 BC. Uruk, Uma, or Ur are a series of distinct city-states. Each was ruled by an absolute king whose legitimacy was the deputy of a local guardian deity. Despite the importance of this civilization and the discovery of its king lists, the truth is that not much is known about them. For example, it is known that their economy was based on agriculture and that they were the first to use cuneiform writing. They are also known to have built great religious temples. Similarly, evidence suggests that the city of Uruk extended its culture throughout southern Mesopotamia. Due to its influence, more cities were built in other regions. Frequent wars led to these cities being equipped with defensive walls[3].    The Akkadian Empire  The prosperity enjoyed by the Sumerians brought various nomadic tribes to the region. Among these peoples of Semitic origin were Arabs, Hebrews and Syrians. Invasions have been constant since 2500 BC. and they soon succeeded in gaining political supremacy over the Sumerians. In 3000 BC, waves of migration reached the northern part of Mesopotamia. As a result, groups such as the Amorites were created, including the Phoenicians, Hebrews, Arameans, and Akkadians, the more prominent Semitic peoples. In 1350 BC, the Akkadians conquered the city of Kish. Later, under the leadership of Sargon, they founded a new capital called Agadeand began to conquer the remaining cities of Sumer. After this conquest, the Akkadian Empire became the first in history. Political instability in the region affected the empire after Sargon's death. Among them, the distinguished heirs had to face many rebellions. Nevertheless, Sargon's grandson Naram-Sin managed to expand his rule at the expense of other city-states. Finally, constant rebellions and invasions by the Guthis and the Amorites led to the opening of the empire, and around 2220 BC the Amorites came to rule the entire region[4].    Sumerian Renaissance  Some Sumerian city-states managed to resist the Akkadians. Among them, Uruk is one of the most important. According to the monument, he was a king of Uruk named Utu-gigal, who led the brief restoration of Sumerian power. By 2100 BC, the monarch defeated the Guti who settled in the lands of Sumer. Another Sumerian king from Ur in turn defeated Utu-gigal. This allowed Ur to recognize Uruk as the most powerful city in the region during the so-called Renaissance of Uruk. In contrast to earlier developments, the Ur monarchs attempted to create a centralized Sumerian power in the image of what Sargon had done during the Akkadian Empire. Furthermore, they began a campaign of conquest until their territory exceeded that of the Akkadians. This phase ended in 2003 BCE, when the Amorite conquerors in Arabia defeated the Sumerians[5].    Babylonians and Assyrians    New Babylonian City Map  As Ur lost its hegemony, the region gradually became a different Amorite in almost every city. experienced the rise of dynasties. Several of them argued for dominance in the following decades. Conflicts and raids were constant. A number of powerful states emerged in northern Mesopotamia, probably driven by trade with Anatolia. Among these states, Assyria stood out, which managed to expand to the Mediterranean Sea.    Crisis of the Babylonian Empire  Hammurapi's ascension to the throne of Babylon, which was insignificant at the time, took place in 1792 BC. The monarch began a strategy of expanding his dominions, beginning with the conflict with Ur. After defeating several neighboring kingdoms and a coalition formed by cities along the Tigris, Hammurabi declared himself the Sumerian Akkadian, which emerged under Sargon and was used to consolidate control over all of Mesopotamia. The expansion of the kingdom continued in the following years until it annexed Assyria and Eshnunna in the northern part of Mesopotamia in 1753. Hammurabi's work led to the mythologizing of his figure. In addition to his military victories, he is responsible for the construction of large infrastructures and the creation of the first law code for mankind. After the death of the monarch, in 1750 BC, his son Samsu-iluna took the throne. From that time, nomadic tribes Casitas began to attack the kingdom. These invasion attempts continued into the 17th century BC, destroying the empire. Eventually, the Hittite king Mursili I ended the Babylonian resistance and the Kassites took over the region[6].    The Assyrians  Around 1250 BC, Assyria conquered all of northern Mesopotamia. This city was organized into city-states, and the monarchy was based in two regional capitals: Nineveh and Assur. Before this happened, the Assyrians had a dominant position in business with Anatolia. In that peninsula they established some trading ports that they used to transport gold, silver, and bronze[7].      Mesopotamia, ship image  The Assyrians, who were ruled by other empires before establishing their own kingdom, were also great warriors, known for being very violent. were Their mastery of forging iron gave them an advantage in addition to good weapons. One of its most glorious times was during the reign of Tiglathpileser I (1115-1077 BC). This king defeated Nebuchadnezzar I in Babylon and extended his rule to the Mediterranean Sea. However, its power declined in the following century.    The New Babylonian Empire  Another Semitic people, the Chaldeans, were responsible for Babylon's recovery. It was King Nabopolassar who refounded the city at the end of the 7th century. His son Nebuchadnezzar II inherited the throne and became one of the most important rulers in the entire history of Mesopotamia. Through his policies and conquests, his empire spread from Mesopotamia to Syria and the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.    Persian Conquest  This revival of Babylon lasted until 539 BC.reached, at that time the Persian king Cyrus conquered the city and established his rule throughout Mesopotamia[8].    Agriculture  The geographical location of Mesopotamia between the Tigris and the Euphrates made agriculture the main economic activity. However, the lack of rain has made it very difficult to grow crops in lands far from river basins. Therefore, the inhabitants of the region had to build an efficient irrigation system that would bring water to their land. In addition to technical innovations to improve irrigation, the Mesopotamians invented the wheel and the plow. By using both elements, they were able to work the land more easily. Among the most common products were cereals (barley, wheat, rye or sesame), olive trees, dates or grapes.    Trade  Initially, everything produced was intended for domestic consumption. Over time, there was a surplus that could be used for trade. On the other hand, artisans made items that could be used commercially, such as eating utensils, tools, patterns, or weights for machines. The Sumerians established long-distance trade routes for some time. Thus, it became known that they reached Anatolia, Syria and India. They usually exchanged Mesopotamia-made products for raw materials such as wood, stone, or metal[9]. Often, these metals were used to make powerful weapons. Similarly, they were used to make work tools. By 3500 BC, bronze was common. This copper-tin alloy was stronger than other materials and was used for tools, weapons, or ornaments. Another use of this alloy that greatly improved life in the region was as a material to make metal sheets for bullock plows[10].    Religion  The various civilizations located in Mesopotamia had their own gods and beliefs. The common denominator is that all religions were polytheistic.    Characteristics of the Gods  As noted, the various religions of Mesopotamia were polytheistic. This means that they worshiped different gods. As in Greek mythology, the Mesopotamian gods were generally human in appearance and behavior. So they ate, married, fought, or had children. However, unlike humans, these gods were immortal and had great powers. In general, the people of Mesopotamia were afraid of their gods. They were very vindictive and did not hesitate to be cruel when people disobeyed them. Even kings could not punish, so the gods always turned to the priests to see if they approved of their decisions[11].    Major Gods    Athanasius Kircher - Turris Babel - 1679 (page 145 crop)  Gods in Mesopotamia pantheon was generally hierarchical. Thus, there were some major gods and some minor gods. The most important Sumerian gods were Enlil (water god), Enki (earth god) and Aun (sky god). After the Semitic conquest, this trinity was replaced by Ishtar (goddess of war, fertility and love), Sin (god of the moon) and Shamash (god of the stars and the Sun). In the 2nd millennium BC, the rule of Babylon brought further religious changes. Marduk, the god of the city, grew in importance and became the main deity[12].    Priests (Priests)  The importance of religion made the priests one of the most powerful classes. His duty was to undertake the daily rituals and organization of religious holidays. Priests, men and women, were always from upper class families. The religion of the inhabitants of Mesopotamia included magic among their beliefs. Because of this, they thought that the priests had certain powers, such as the ability to cast out demons. Another important factor in Mesopotamian religion from the 3rd millennium BC. it was the presence of holy prostitution. It was related to the cult of Ishtar. Sadiq paid the priest to have sex with him, thus honoring the goddess. The women who held these clerical positions were socially highly respected.    References  Initially, writing was used only for official documents, especially accounting. Later it was used to represent events, stories, legends or disasters. This means the birth of a written literature that was initially focused on religious aspects. Thus, the Sumerians wrote on three major themes:    Hymns, which were texts in praise of the gods[13].  Kings or cities, gods involvedlegends related to the stories in it.  They recorded any catastrophic event and believed that it caused the wrath of the gods.  The Sumerians wrote a type of poetry in the form of a dialogue in addition to collections of proverbs.    Sculpture  The main theme of Mesopotamian sculpture was gods and rulers. Each work is perfectly individualized and in most cases includes the name of the featured character. Monumental and parietal, stele, enameled brick and seal were the easiest methods. The latter allowed them to develop a complete history. When depicting people, artists did not seek perfect proportions. In a style called conceptual realism, the head and face were proportional. The bodies, on the other hand, were generally symmetrical. Another recurring theme was the representation of large bulls. In this case, the sculptors chose realism. These animals were considered protective geniuses in the region.      Mesopotamia  Countries in Mesopotamia  1\\tShummer\\t  4th millennium BC    2\\tAkkad\\t4th millennium BC  3\\tLagash\\tMil .

  "minorai_kalon": "Tower Kalon",
  "minorai_kalon_desc": "Minarai Kalon (Big Tower), Arslan Khan Tower is an architectural monument in Bukhara. It is part of Poyi Kalon architectural ensemble. It is the tallest structure of Old Bukhara, 47.5 meters high. At one time, as a result of the attack of the Russian Empire, 26 bombs were hit, but did not fall. This structure was built in 1127 on the basis of the project of the architect Usta Baqo by the order of the Karakhani ruler Arslan Khan [1]. Currently, the tower is included in the national list of immovable property objects of the material and cultural heritage of Uzbekistan. After the old minaret collapsed, Arslankhan minaret was built in its place [1]. One of the main tasks of the minaret was to call Muslims to prayer. Minarets are mostly built in front of a mosque or in front of a mosque. Another function of the tower was to observe the enemy during times of turmoil and war. At one time, Minorai Kalon served for observation from above and for religious affairs, in particular, to call the population to the Poyi Kalon mosque for Eid prayers and Friday prayers. The tower also served as a measurement for some buildings to be built in the city[2]. In some sources, there are hypotheses that this place was a place of spectacular execution during the Bukhara Emirate. There are many legends associated with this great structure. In one of them, it is said that the master-builder who restored the foundation of the minaret from a mixture of camel's milk and alabaster suddenly disappeared and returned two years later, when the foundation was mature and solid, and began the work of raising the structure from bricks. It was built in 1127 by Arslan Khan Muhammad from the Karakhanid dynasty based on the project of engineer and architect Baqo. The foundation is made of a mixture of stone and special rock. In 1920, Minorai Kalon was badly damaged as a result of the invasion of the Red Army led by Frunze. Today, there are traces of damaged areas on the tower [3]. The foundation of Kalon Tower was discovered and explored by the local historian S. N. Yurenov in the 1950s, but he could not reach the ancient layer of the city due to seepage [4]. Minorai Kalon was also damaged by the 1976 Gazli earthquake. Oriental scholar Ghulam Karimi in his historical book \"Arslon Khan Tower\" proved that this building is not the Tower of Arslon Khan, but Arslon Khan Tower [5]. This tower is located in Poi Kalon complex. The complex includes Masjidi Kalon, Minorai Kalon, Miri Arab and Amir Olim Khan Madrasa. According to the historian and scientist Kahramon Rajabov, Minorai Kalon is one of the tallest and largest towers in the Turkestan region.    Architecture  Minorai Kalon is 10 m deep from the ground level, 47.5 m high, the seat is sharp, the body is spherical, and the top is connected with a round cage-box with a dome. . The tower tapers upwards and ends with a muqarnas. You can observe the surroundings through 16 arched windows in the cage. The 105-step spiral staircase inside the tower leads to the top. There is a bridge leading to the minaret from Kalon Mosque. Both the core and the decoration of Minarai Kalon are brick (27x27x4x5 cm) made of ganchkhok clay. Depending on the location, the decorative brick has different shapes and a smooth surface. Beautifully decorated rings of different geometrical shapes, which are placed on top of each other, are framed by brick pediments. Kufic inscriptions of historical and religious content can be found among the decorations on the minaret. Each of the blue enamel rings below the muqarnas is decorated with a different geometrical pattern (later shed). Minorai Kalon occupies a special place among the ancient structures of this type. Similarity and proportion of forms, geometrical harmony, great beauty and majesty give Minorai Kalon real beauty. The tower stands out for its strength since 900 years. There are more than 20 decorative rings on the belt of Minarai Kalon[2].    In the recent past  1924 The body and muqarnas were repaired. In 1960, the underground base (chair) was opened and repaired by master Ochil Bobomurodov. In 1997, on the occasion of the 2500th anniversary of Bukhara, Minorai Kalon was renovated. \"Minorai Kalon is one of the unique and ancient monuments of Bukhara city.\",",

  "misr_ehromlari_desc": "In the area bordering the ancient Nile Valley with the Libyan desert, where green fields and Phoenician palm trees are replaced by yellow sand dunes, mountains in an unnatural wind can be seen. The blackness of these mountains can be seen from far away even from the city of Cairo, which is several tens of kilometers away from the Fayoum oasis. Strange appearance, geometric accuracy, historical appeal, mighty grandeur, all these are embodied in Egyptian ehrams. Research scientists have so far identified about a hundred ehrams, large and small, with a step-shaped or very flat surface, which have been hidden under the desert sands from the lower reaches of the Nile for thousands of years. These huge structures surround the city of Memphis, the ancient capital of Egypt, which tells the story of thousands of years of history. All three famous twin pyramids were built in Giza, the plain where the ancient and legendary capital is located. You know them. These are the shrines of Cheops, Chephren and Mykeren. The largest among the pyramids is the Cheops (or Khufu) pyramid, which belongs to the most powerful pharaoh Khufu among the representatives of the IV dynasty. This huge pyramid is still preserved as a great example of human handiwork. The base of the Ehram is square, and the length of each side is 227.5 meters. This size does not differ from one another even to the extent of a finger's width. So, in order to completely circle the Cheops pyramid, you will have to walk about a kilometer. The height of this huge ehram was 146.5 meters when it was built. The sword of the arbiter of time has cut off the 10-meter height of the Ehram peak. Now it is 137 meters. However, the tomb of the pharaohs, who were cursed in the holy books, remained the tallest man-made structure in the world until the 19th century. In terms of height, the fruit of the skill of the architect Eiffel was the first to surpass it.    The second largest among the pyramids in Giza belongs to the pharaoh Khafren, which was built 40 years after the pyramid of Cheops. The length of the sides of the base of this ihram is 215 meters, and the height is 136 meters. The white basalt covering of the ancient decorative pattern on the top of the ehram is partially preserved.    The third ehram is much smaller than the previous two. It belonged to the pharaoh Mikerin and managed to preserve its elegance for thousands of years. The length of the sides of this small pyramid was 108 meters, and the height was 66.5 meters (now 62 meters). However, none of them have a clear answer to why these huge mountains were built. So, why were the Egyptian ehrams built?    The paintings of various forms on the walls of the ehrams can provide the most accurate answer to this question. However, it is certainly not possible to preserve the local intelligentsia for thousands of years who understands the secrets hidden behind the pictures of the objects that are found in nature. However, the sweat on their foreheads is the most suitable key for this lock. In 1913, a group of British researchers found a tablet engraved with a Greek-ancient Egyptian dictionary written by an unknown thinker in the lower reaches of the Nile. Thanks to this dictionary, it is possible to understand 20% of the language spoken by the inhabitants of ancient Egypt. However, the reason for the construction of the pyramids, which we want to know, lies under the remaining 80 percent of secrets. avns' desire to live forever is preserved. Their mummified bodies, the idea that the child of the sun in the paintings is a pharaoh - all this is clear evidence.\" Henri Fuqua (France) - \"The main way of life of the local people living on the banks of the Nile is this associated with the river. Of course, high-ranking governors also understood this. Ehrams kept the earth's surface and sunlight stable. Heavy mountains near the capital significantly reduce flooding during the flood season. He continues this reasoning with other structures in different parts of the world built in the form of ihram. In his opinion, the ancient pyramids in the Solomon Islands and Yucatan were built for the same purpose.    For information, it should be mentioned that the treasure of the legendary king Solomon's entire head was found in a pyramid in the Solomon Islands (1863). However, more than a dozen explorers who wanted to explore this structure had to stop their journey halfway due to various poisonous gases coming out of the stones. However, English sailor Godley Olgren was able to reach the king's treasure.    The pyramid in Yucatan was built for astronomical observations.There are speculations that.    Jason Gird (Great Britain) - \"Ehrams served strategic purposes. Through it, the local population could easily monitor the movements of the enemy about a hundred miles away from the capital. In addition, they were a means of proving the greatness of the ancient Egyptian army and culture.\" In fact, during the Second World War, the air defense system of the United Kingdom in Africa flattened these ehrams as much as possible and built observation points there. Because only the astrologer monks were mediators between the pharaoh and the gods. Later, the kings hoped to be close to God and asked them to bury their mummified bodies in ihram.\" For example, Alba Gunte, an Egyptologist from California (USA), believes that the ehrams were not built by human hands. He said that even modern equipment is not enough to build such a huge structure. These shrines were built by aliens. As he continues his thoughts, he tries to prove his opinion by the fact that the pyramids were built on the basis of an extremely sophisticated plan, and not even a needle could fit between its stones. named after li. After the pharaoh's death, his body was kept in special sarcophagi in these rooms. We will continue our comments with Ms. M. Shakir's notes about the pyramid of Cheops. But only one of them can lead you to the room where the pharaoh's tomb is located. Because along this corridor you will come across a rather wide corridor and several corridors that come off of it. So, the \"branching\" of the corridors inside the ehram was built on purpose so that you do not get to the pharaoh's sarcophagus. The possibility of looting the countless riches around the sarcophagus worried the architects even at that time. There's no end to the wrong paths... You can't find a way out of a huge labyrinth like a labyrinth and you can't find a way out. (Many times during my observations I came across the bones of the lucky ones who couldn't find the exit)\".    One of the corridors from the wide corridor leads you to the pharaoh's tomb, and the special corridor from it is the one you are actually looking for. leads to a special room full of gold jewelry and various household items. The ancient Egyptians believed that after a person's death, a king becomes a king, a gado becomes a gado, and continues to live in the other world. Therefore, the pharaoh showed the gatekeeper of the other world the gold jewelry of one world and continued his previous action in the other world.    Unfortunately, mankind is always hungry for wealth. Only the stepped pyramid of Joser north of Memphis and the Shulek ehram built in the desert have yielded traceable objects. None of the three great pyramids at Giza yielded mummified bodies or riches. It seems that the architects who built it were very thorough.",

  "neptun_sayyorasi_desc": "Neptune is the eighth planet in the solar system in terms of orbital distance, an ice giant and the outermost. This dwarf planet has been part of the Kuiper Belt since Pluto ceased to be considered a planet in 2006. Neptune in the night sky until space missions such as Voyager 2 in the late 1980s provided information about the planet and its moons. it looks like a tiny blue dot, about which little is known.    Voyager 2 images for the first time show dark anticyclonic patches with blue-green surfaces, strong storms and fast wind currents showed the producing planet. They are very similar to Jupiter's, but not as constant in time.    Neptune's atmosphere is rich in methane and has a very weak ring system. The planet has a magnetosphere, so it is thought to have a metallic core. So far, 15 moons of Neptune have been calculated, among which Triton and Nereida are the main moons.    Discovery and history  The discovery of Neptune The planets Uranus and Saturn was the result of a mathematical prediction based on observations of disturbances in their orbits. Previously, in 1610, Galileo saw Neptune with the telescope that discovered the moons of Jupiter, but he thought it was a star. Much later, in 1846, the French mathematician Urben Le Verrier, who specialized in celestial mechanics, discovered the orbits of Saturn and Uranus. studied the disturbances. The best explanation was to suggest the existence of a new planet, which predicted its rotation and position in the sky. The next step was to find a planet, so Le Verrier convinced the German astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle to look for it. On the night of September 23, 1846, Galle confirmed the existence of a new planet from his observatory in Berlin, and a few days later its largest satellite Triton appeared.    Almost at the same time, a young mathematician John Couch Adams, who had been working on the problem for some time in Cambridge, England, made the same prediction.    Neptune owes its name to the sea god (equivalent to the Greek god Poseidon) in Roman mythology. which followed the tradition of naming the planets after the gods of the Roman pantheon.    General characteristics  Neptune is almost 4 times the diameter of Earth, but only one-third the size of giant Jupiter.  It has 17 times the mass of Earth and its volume 57 times more. It is the third most massive planet in the Solar System and the fourth largest.    Summary of Neptune's main physical properties:  -Age: 1,024 Ã 1026 kg (17,147 times that of Earth)  -Mean radius : 24.622 km, equal to 3.87 times the radius of the Earth.  -Shape: smoothed by a factor of 0.983 at the poles.- Average radius of the orbit: 4.498 x 109 km equal to 30.07 U.A.   âInclination of the axis of rotation: 30Âº relative to the orbital plane.    - Temperature: -220ÂºC (clouds)    -Gravity: 11.15 m / s2 (1.14 g)    - Self-magnetic field: Yes, 14 microtesla at the equator.    - Atmosphere: Hydrogen 84%, helium 12%, methane 2%, ammonia 0.01%.    -Density: 1,640 kg / m3     - Moons: 15 known to date.    -Rings: Yes, they are thin, made of ice particles and silicates.    Translational Motion  The Sun Neptune, the eighth planet in the system, is a gas giant with an average radius of 30 AU around the Sun. One astronomical unit is equal to 150 million kilometers and is the average distance between the Sun and the Earth.    This means that the radius of Neptune's trajectory is 30 times greater than that of Earth, so it takes 165 years to make one revolution around the Sun.   n  Fun facts about Neptune  - It is the farthest planet from the Sun because Pluto, which is after the orbit of Neptune, is now a dwarf planet.    -Neptune is the smallest of the four giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune). .    -Neptune's gravity is very similar to Earth's.    -It is the coldest planet in the Solar System, with an average temperature of -221.4ÂºC.    - It has a ring system, but named after Saturn in contrast, they are not continuous, but instead form arcs along their orbital paths.    -Neptune is the densest of the giant planets.    - Storms with the fastest winds in the Solar System there are, they can reach a staggering 2100 km/h.    -Neptune has an Earth-sized vortex, the Great Dark Spot. Photographed in 1989, this spot disappeared in 1994, but a new Dark Spot appeared. rotates in the opposite direction, so it is thought to have been captured by the planet and not formed at the same time.    -Triton (Neptune's largest moon) has volcanoes and nitrogen geysers, but it is the Sun one of the coldest stars in the system (-235ÂºC).    - The Voyager 2 mission visited Neptune in 1989passed 3,000 kilometers from the north pole of the Sun.    On July 12, 2011, Neptune completed its first complete orbit since its discovery on September 23, 1846. is 15 hours, 57 minutes and 59 seconds by measurement.    Determining the rotation speed of a planet that only shows the surface of its atmosphere and moves is not an easy task. The rotation speed of the rocky planets is much easier to determine.    When Voyager 2 reached Neptune in 1989, its rotation period was 16 hours and 6.5 seconds. Today, thanks to the excellent measurements of University of Arizona planetary scientist Erich Karkoschka, this measurement is known to be incorrect.    Rotation rate and magnetic field The rotation rate of other giant planets is measured by the pulses emitted by the magnetic field. However, this method does not apply to Neptune, because neither the axis nor the center of the magnetic dipole coincides with the axis of rotation of our planet, as we can see in the following comparative picture: A model of the magnetic field produced by (magnet) is shown. This model also fits the Earth's magnetic field.    However, Neptune's field is anomalous, meaning that quadrupole and higher-order inputs can be larger than the dipole field. And as we can see in the picture, the dipole is shifted from the center.    So, using more than five hundred images from the Hubble telescope, Karkoschka developed another method. He found two unique features of our planet: South Pole Feature Y South Pole Wave.    They have been rotating at the same speed since the 1990s, confirming that this is the true speed of our planet.    Figure 5 (above) shows the planet's speed. Colors and contrasts modified by filters to highlight atmospheric features are shown.    As mentioned, the wind in Neptune's atmosphere often exceeds the speed of sound. Thus, Neptune's Great Dark Spot changes over time. changes its relative position, Dark Spot 2 and the South Polar feature keep their relative positions. This means that they depend on the rotation of the planet, which allowed Karkoschka to accurately determine the length of the day on Neptune.    Composition  Neptune's atmosphere consists of hydrogen (84%), helium (12%), methane (2%) and other gases such as ammonia, ethane and acetylene are present. This atmosphere contains a mixture of water, liquid ammonia, methane, and molten rock containing silicon, iron, and nickel.    Increasing concentrations of methane, ammonia, and water are found in the lower regions of the atmosphere. Unlike its twin planet Uranus, Neptune's composition is more oceanic.    Structure  The planet has a rocky core surrounded by an icy shell, all under a dense and thick atmosphere that occupies about a third of its radius. It is similar to the twin planet of Uranus.    The image below shows Neptune's structure in more detail.Neptune has a well-defined layered structure:    âUpper layer: it consists mainly of clouds of hydrogen and helium and to a lesser extent methane and other gases . It accounts for about 5-10% of the planet's mass.âAtmosphere: hydrogen, helium, and methane.    âMantle: beneath the atmosphere is the planet's great mantle, which can reach temperatures of 1772-7727Â°C is a liquid region that consists of liquid water, methane, and ammonia.    The mantle is 10 to 15 land masses and is rich in water, ammonia, and methane. This mixture is called \\\"ice\\\" despite being a hot, dense liquid, and it is also called an ocean of water and ammonia. top.    âCore: another ice and gas giant composed of silicon, iron, and nickel, similar to Uranus. The nuclear mass is 1.2 times that of the Earth. The pressure at the center is 700 GPa, about twice that of the Earth's center, and the temperature is 5,670 ÂºC.  However, Neptune has an internal heat source, possibly from collisions of conduction electrons in the liquid mantle, as well as residual heat during its formation. Because of this.    This huge temperature gradient creates massive convection currents, forcing our planet's climate system to extremes.    And thus producing the largest storms and storms in the Solar System, which suggests that anticyclonic currents are due to opposite winds at different latitudes.    Among all anticyclonic systems of Neptune, the Great Dark Spot stands out, which was first photographed by the Voyager 2 probe in 1989 at a distance of 3000 km from the planet.    Color Neptune has a bluer color than Uranus, because it absorbs red wavelengths and reflects blue wavelengths due to its high concentration of methane. But it is the head that contributes to its colorqa molecules are also present.    The temperature decreases with height in the lower region of the atmosphere (troposphere), but the opposite occurs in the upper region (stratosphere). The pressure between these layers is 10 thousand pascals (Pa).    Above the stratosphere is the thermosphere, which gradually turns into the exosphere, where the pressure decreases from 10 Pa to 1 Pa. Atmosphere  Neptune's atmosphere is very interesting and deserves a separate section is worthy. First of all, it is very cold because it is the farthest planet from the Sun and receives very little solar radiation. Therefore, the temperature in the upper part of the atmosphere is in the order of -220 ÂºC.  Neptune's moons  To date, 15 natural satellites of our planet have been calculated. The largest of its moons, and the first to be discovered in 1846, is Triton. In 1949, a second moon was discovered, named Nereida.    In 1989, the Voyager 2 mission discovered six more moons: Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Galatea, Larissa, and Proteus.    Later in 2003, Halimedes, San , Laomedia, Psamatus and Neso were found. 14 small moons were discovered by the SETI Institute in 2013 with an orbital period of 23 hours.    Let's look at some details about Neptune's main moons:    Triton  This is Neptune's sun The largest of the satellites, with a diameter of 2,700 km, it is 18 times smaller than its home planet and almost 5 times smaller than Earth.    Its orbital period is almost 6 days, but interestingly, it orbits Neptune and other artificial planets. rotates in the opposite direction to the rotation of the partners. In addition, its orbit is inclined by 30 degrees with respect to the orbital plane of our planet. It is the coldest object in the Solar System, with an average temperature of -235 Â°C and is composed of three quarters of rock and one quarter of ice. On its surface there are geysers, which have dark emissions towards the atmosphere, and the surface shows plains and some volcanoes with craters 200 km long. Nereid  It was discovered by Gerard Kuiper in 1949 because it reflects 14% of the sunlight it receives.    It is about one-eighth the size of Triton and has a very eccentric orbit, with the closest distance to Neptune being 1,354,000 km and the farthest distance being 9,624,000 km traveled in 360 days. Proteus  This irregular moon was discovered by the Voyager 2 mission in 1989 and is the second largest of Neptune's moons. It is a very porous, low-density satellite.    Despite its large size, it could not be detected by telescopes because it is so dark and reflects little sunlight. Its average diameter is on the order of 400 km, 6.7 times smaller than Triton.    Neptune's rings. Neptune has five thin and faint rings composed mostly of dust and ice particles. Its origin is believed to be in the debris left by collisions between meteorites and natural satellites of our planet.    The rings are named after the scientists who contributed the most to their discovery and study. From inner to outer they are Galle, Le Verrier, Lassell, Arago and Adams.    There is also a ring that shares its orbit with the satellite Galatea, which we can see in the image below: When Neptune and how to observe  Neptune cannot be seen with the naked eye, and even with an amateur telescope it appears so small that it can be mistaken for a star.    Using a computer program or program that works as a planetarium it's good Sky Maps for Android is a feature that allows you to quickly identify planets and other celestial objects.    The best time to observe is when the planet is at opposition, which is the line between the Earth and the Sun with Neptune. in between.    This event happens every 368 days and by 2020 it will happen on September 11th. This is not the only opportunity to observe Neptune, it is also visible at other times of the year.    With a good telescope, Neptune can be distinguished from the background stars because it looks like a blue-green disc.",

  "ossuriya_desc": "The first empire of the ancient world was Assyria. XXIV to VII century BC - about 609 BC - This country has existed on the world map for almost 2000 years. e. no raised. Assyria is the first word found in, for example, Herodotus, Aristotle and other ancient authors. Also, the kingdom of Assyria is mentioned in some books of the Bible.    GEOGRAPHY  The kingdom of Assyria was on the upper reaches of the Tigris River, and stretched from the Zagras Masios mountains to the northeast and the lower reaches of the Lesser Zab in the south. At different times of its existence, it was located on the lands of such modern countries as Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Turkey, Syria, Cyprus and Egypt.    It has a long history and is not the kingdom of Assyria, but one capital is known:  Ashur (first capital, 250 kilometers from modern Baghdad). HISTORICAL PERIODS OF DEVELOPMENT  Since the story of the Assyrian kingdom takes a long period of time, its existence is divided into three periods conditioned by the period:    Staroassiriysky period - XX-XVI centuries.  Sredneassiriysky period - XV-XI centuries.  Neo-Assyrian empire - X-VII century.  Our state is characterized by its internal and foreign policy. In each period, the authorities were priests from different dynasties, and each subsequent period caused the Assyrians to change to a prosperous state and the direction of the Kingdom's foreign policy. began to change.    STAROASSIRIYSKY PERIOD  Assyrians entered the Euphrates region in the middle of the 20th century. BC. e., Akkadian language tribes said. The first Assyrian city was built, named after their supreme god.     During the death of the Assyrian kingdom, Assyria, which still had a slave kingdom of Nome Mitanni and Kassite Babylon, was many, so Assyria had no state. Nominal internal affairs of the settlements retain some independence. By Ashshurskomu, Nome includes several small village communities led by elders. Thanks to the favorable geographical location of the city, it was quickly connected by trade routes from the south, east and west. The rulers of this situation were characterized by the full political rights of the bearers. During this period, the decision of the monarch was not accepted. This period in Assyrian history has been isolated by historians as a prequel to the Assyrian kingdom for convenience. Akkad was a part of Assyria until the fall of the XXII century BC, but it became independent for a short time after its disappearance, and only until the XXI century AD. e. Ur was captured. Only after 200 years will the rulers of electricity pass - from Ashshurtsam, from which the rapid growth of trade and production of goods will begin. However, this relationship within the state did not last long, and after 100 years Ashur, the Central City lost its importance, and one of the sons of the ruler Shamsht-Baghishlab became the governor. Soon the city was under the authority of the king of Babylon, Hammurabi, and only from 1720 AD. e. This is the beginning of the gradual rise of the independent Assyrian state. SECOND PERIOD  In official documents from the 14th century AD, Assyrian governors are already called kings. In addition, they, \\\"our brother.\", Derlar Phenicia and Syria, the city and in the biennium 1290-1260, conquered the kingdom of Babylon and made campaigns against the Hittite state. BC. e. The territorial design of the Assyrian Empire ends. The Assyrian conquest of the new growth in fact, the king of ships in the Mediterranean Sea several times, to show his superiority over Egypt, northern Syria, Phoenicia got a hand Tiglatpilasar , and began during the period of Asia Minor. After the death of a king, the state begins to decline, and all subsequent kings can now retain the territories they previously occupied. The Assyrian kingdom was driven from its local lands. The period of documents is in the XI-X centuries BC. e. It shows its decline, it is preserved. NEO-ASSURIAN EMPIRE  A new stage of Assyrian development began after the Assyrians managed to get rid of the Aramaic tribes came to their territory. This state, created during this period, is the first empire in the history of mankind. The Assyrian kingdom was unable to stop the prolonged crisis by consecrating the kings-nirari II and Adid-nirari III (- the mother of vineyards Semiramis was a tie to the existence of one of the 7 wonders of the world). Unfortunately, the following three kings could not resist the external enemy attack - the Kingdom of Urartu and a large state weakened and conducted an illiterate internal policy. Being in power in 745-727. BC. e., he managed to capture the lands of Phenicia, Palestine, Syria, the armed conflict between the kingdom of Damascus and the state of Urartu was resolved for many years, it was during his time.     South y Assyria, a kingdom of the Caucasus, forced the governors to carry out small political reforms. Thus, together with the king, Aramaic spread throughout Assyria, with their families and property, the inhabitants of the land from the conquered country began to be forcibly removed. The king, therefore, decided the problem of separatism, the emergence of new dynasties in our country, not giving but a large area with many small heads. Also, the royal army was reformed: the army of volunteers and military colonists was transformed into a professional permanent army that received salaries from the treasury, a new type of soldier was introduced - regular cavalry and combat engineers, with special attention to intelligence and communication organized.      Tiglatpilasar's successful military campaign allowed the creation of an empire stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Persian Gulf, and even crowned as the king of Babylon - Pula.    URARTU - EMPIRE (CAUCASUS), ASSYRIAN RULER INVASION  The Kingdom of Urartu was located on the Armenian Plateau and occupied the territory of modern Armenia, Eastern Turkey, Northern Iran and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan. From the middle of the 9th century AD to the middle of the 8th century AD, Urartu mainly contributed to the war with the Assyrian Kingdom. After the death of King Tiglathpilaser III, he returned to the state control over the trade routes of Asia Minor. strove for. 735 BC. e. Assyria was able to break the Urartu army in a decisive battle on the west bank of the Euphrates River and move to the Kingdom. Monarch Urartu Sarduri fled and died soon after, the state was in a miserable state. His successor, Rusa I, was able to establish a temporary peace with the Assyrians, which was recently broken by the Assyrian king Sargon II.    Urartu, weakened by the defeat of Sargon II 714 BC tribes that could not see anything, took the truth use e. Urartu's armies were destroyed, and thus Urartu and its dependent kingdoms were ruled by Assyria. After these events, Urartu lost its importance on the world stage.    POLICY PAST ASSYRIAN KINGS  Tiglatpilasar III's successor took over the empire established by his predecessor. could not, and in time Babylon declared its independence. The next king in his foreign policy, Sargon II, was not limited to holding only the Kingdom of Urartu, he was able to take control of Babylon, Assyria and was crowned as the king of Babylon, and he was able to suppress all the unrest that occurred in the territory of the empire. It's done.     The history of the Assyrian kingdom      During the reign of Sennacherib (705-680 BC) is characterized by constant conflicts between the king and the citizens with the priests. During his time, the former king of Babylon tried to establish his authority, which led to the fact that Sennacherib was punished by the Babylonians and completely destroyed Babylon. Dissatisfaction with the king's policy led to the weakening of the state and, as a result, the outbreak of rebellions, some states won their independence, and some territories of Urartu were captured. This policy led to the murder of the king.    Once the power, first of all, the successor of the king Esarhaddon was able to restore the fallen Babylon and establish relations with the priests. In connection with foreign policy, the king of Phoenicia undertook a successful campaign to suppress the Cimmerian anti-Assyrian rebellion and capture Memphis and ascend to the throne of Egypt, but due to the unexpected death of the king, he did not win was able to save.    THE LAST ASSYRIAN KING  Assyria was the last powerful king of Assyria, known as the most learned ruler, Ashshurbanipal. It was he who collected a unique library of clay tablets in his palace. His period was characterized by a constant struggle for the independence of the state. During this period Assyria was completely defeated by the second war with the kingdom of Elam. Egypt and Babylon gained their independence, but they did not succeed due to many conflicts. Ashshurbanipalu was able to expand his influence in Lydia, media, Phrygia to crush Thebes.     The main city of the Assyrian kingdom    DEATH OF THE ASSYRIAN KINGDOM  The death of Assurbanipal marked the beginning of the Troubles. Assyria was defeated by the Medes, the kingdom of Babel became independent. united Median forces and their allies in 612 BC. e. Nineveh - the main city of the Assyrian kingdom was destroyed. 605 BC. e.

  "ozodlik_haykali": "statue of Liberty",
  "ozodlik_haykali_desc": "The Statue of Liberty, or, as it is called, Lady Liberty, has symbolized the spread of freedom and democracy for many years. A bright symbol of freedom is the statue trampling on broken shackles. Located on the North American mainland in New York, this magnificent establishment is always available to all guests and provides the most unforgettable experience. Creation of the Statue of Liberty  The monument went down in history as a gift from the French government to the United States. According to the official version, this event was held in honor of celebrating the 100th anniversary of America's independence, as well as as a sign of friendship between the two countries. The author of the project was Edouard Rene Lefebvre de Labuele, the leader of the French anti-slavery movement. Work on the creation of the statue began in France in 1875 and was completed in 1884. It was headed by the talented French sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi. It was this well-known person who for 10 years in his art studio created a symbol of freedom of the future. The work was carried out in collaboration with the best minds of France. The designers of the Eiffel Tower project, Gustave Eiffel, participated in the construction of the inner iron frame of the famous statue. The work was continued by one of his assistants, engineer Maurice Kechlin. The grand ceremony of presenting the French gift to their American counterparts was scheduled for July 1876. Lack of funds has been an obstacle to the implementation of the plan. American President Grover Cleveland was able to accept the gift of the French government in a ceremonial setting only after 10 years. The date of the ceremonial dedication of the statue was October 1886. Bedlow Island has been designated as a historic ceremony site. After 70 years, it received the name \\\"Island of Freedom\\\". Description of the legendary landmark  The Statue of Liberty is one of the most famous masterpieces in the world. His right hand proudly holds a torch, and his left hand holds a tablet with letters on it. The inscription shows the date of the most important event for the entire American people - the Independence Day of the United States of America. The dimensions of Lady Liberty are impressive. Its height from the ground to the top of the torch is 93 meters. The size of the head is 5.26 meters, the length of the nose is 1.37 m, the eyes are 0.76 m, the arms are 12.8 meters, the length of each arm is 5 m, the size of the plate is 7.19 m.     I wonder what the Statue of Liberty is made of. It took at least 31 tons of copper to dispose of his body. The weight of the entire steel structure is about 125 tons. The 25-view window in the crown is a symbol of the country's wealth. The rays emanating from it are 7 pieces and are a symbol of the seven continents and seas. In addition, they symbolize the expansion of freedom in all directions. Traditionally, people arrive at the monument by ferry. A favorite place to visit is the crown. It is necessary to climb a special platform inside it to watch the local landscapes and the view of the New York coast from above. For this purpose, visitors have to climb many steps - 192 to the top of the base, and then 356 in the body itself. As a reward for the most persistent visitors, there are sweeping views of New York and its beautiful surroundings. No less interesting is the foundation, which houses a museum with historical expositions. Interesting Little-Known Facts about the Statue of Liberty  The period of the monument's creation and its subsequent existence are filled with interesting facts and stories. Some of them are not even covered when tourists visit New York City.    The first name of the Statue of Liberty is the name by which this work is known around the world. Initially, it was known as \\\"Freedom Illuminates the World\\\" - \\\"Freedom Illuminates the World\\\". Initially, it was planned to erect a monument in his place in the form of a peasant with a torch in his hand. The place of establishment was to be the territory of Egypt at the entrance to the Suez Canal. This was prevented by the Egyptian government's sudden change of plans. Prototype face of the Statue of Liberty    It is widely believed that the face of the Statue of Liberty is nothing more than a fabrication of the author. However, two versions of its origin are known. According to the first prototype of the face, the face of the famous model of French origin Isabella Boyer became. According to another, Frederick Bartholdi immortalized his mother's face on the monument. Color Metamorphoses    Immediately after creation, the sculpture was distinguished by a bright golden-orange color. In St. Petersburg, visitors to the Hermitage can see the original painting. Today, the monument got a green color. This is due to patination, which causes the metal to acquire a blue-green color when exposed to air. This is an American iconthe transformation took 25 years, which is reflected in many photos. As seen today, the copper coating of the statue has naturally oxidized. ad  The \\\"journey\\\" of the head of Lady Liberty    A fact that no one knows: before all the parts of the French gift were collected in New York, the Statue of Liberty was scattered around the country for some time. He had to travel with his head down. His head was exhibited in one of the Philadelphia museums in 1878. The French also decided to enjoy the spectacle before he left for his destination. In the same year, the head was put on public display at one of the Paris exhibitions. Former record holder    In the 21st century, there are buildings that surpass the symbol of America in terms of height and weight. However, during the years when the statue was designed, its concrete base was the largest and most dimensional concrete structure in the world. Great records soon ceased to be so, but the monument is still associated in the world's mind with something glorious and new. Statue of Liberty Twins    Many replicas of the American symbol have been created around the world, including several dozen in the United States itself. A pair of 9-foot spikes can be seen around New York's Liberty National Bank. Another copy, reduced to 3 meters, decorates the state of California. The official twin copy of the monument appeared at the end of the 80s of the 20th century. The Americans presented it to the French people as a sign of friendship and gratitude. Today this gift can be seen in Paris, on one of the islands of the Seine River. The copy is shortened, but it is able to hit the surrounding people at a height of 11 meters. Residents of Tokyo, Budapest and Lviv erected their own copies of the monument. The smallest Statue of Liberty    The authorship of the minimal copy belongs to residents of western Ukraine - sculptor Mykhailo Kolodko and architect Alexander Bezik. You can see this masterpiece of modern art in Ucar, Zakarpattia. The comic statue is made of bronze, is only 30 cm high and weighs about 4 kg. Today, it symbolizes the local people's desire to express themselves and is known as the smallest replica in the world. The Monument's Extreme \\\"Adventures\\\"  The Statue of Liberty has been through a lot in its lifetime. In July 1916, a brutal terrorist attack was carried out in America. On the island of Black Tom Island, which is located near Liberty Island, explosions were heard, their strength was approximately equal to a 5.5 magnitude earthquake. Their culprits were saboteurs from Germany. During these activities, the monument seriously damaged some of its parts. In 1983, in front of the general public, illusionist David Copperfield performed an unforgettable experiment in which the Statue of Liberty disappeared. The initial focus was successful. The giant statue disappeared, and the stunned onlookers tried in vain to find a logical explanation for what they had seen. In addition to perfect miracles, Copperfield surprised with a luminous ring around the Statue of Liberty and another wonder next to it. Today, the symbol of the United States of America still rises majestically in the sky of New York, maintaining its global importance and being the pride of the American people. For America itself and other countries, it is related to the spread of democratic values, freedom and independence to the whole world. Since 1984, the statue has been included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.

  "petra": "Petra",
  "petra_desc": "Petra is a city located in the territory of present-day Jordan, founded in the 4th century BC. One of the few megalopolises and a major trading city of its time, it serves as an important archaeological and tourist destination. On August 22, 1812, the unique ruins of Petra were discovered by the Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Buckhardt. \"Daryo\" tells about the history of the city, which was named \"Rose City\" due to the date.      The city of Petra  The \"Rose City\" was established as a trading post by the Nabataeans, who were Arab Bedouins living in the region of present-day southwestern Jordan. The Nabateans who lived and traded in the city soon amassed great wealth, and the jealous Greek Empire attacked Petra in 312 BC. It was this event that became the first historical event of the ancient city of Petra. The local population won the battle.  But it was not the only one: the Romans invaded Petra in 106 BC, and the city's inhabitants were eventually defeated. The Roman Empire annexed the newly acquired lands to its territory and changed its name to \"Petra of Arabia\". The rule of the Romans lasted more than 250 years until the middle of the IV century BC. By this time, many buildings in the city had been destroyed by a powerful earthquake.    The Lost City of Petra  By the beginning of the 8th century BC, many people had left Petra and moved to other places, and now it is a center of commerce, politics and it had ceased to be culturally important at all.   Nevertheless, the city stands out for historians and archaeologists as a unique innovation created by its unique architecture, as well as by the people who built it. Petra does not seem like a logical place to build a city, given its surrounding mountainous terrain. The Nabataeans wisely used this geographical location to establish its main structures and built such a city.    The local population began to build the city in a style known as Stone Architecture. Several buildings were carved out of stone surfaces. As the Nabataean culture developed and the Romans and Byzantines also wanted to leave their mark on the city, Petra's architecture began to blend the different cultures that occupied it.    In the evolution that took place during the period when the Romans ruled Petra after the Nabateans, before the Byzantines, it later became the main thoroughfare of the city. served Petra Roman roads were built. Some time later, Roman-style gates were installed at the entrance to the city. Therefore, Petra is a destination for lovers of diverse architecture. Discovery of Petra  After Petra was abandoned as a trading center in the 8th century, its stone structures were used as a shelter by nomadic shepherds for several centuries. Later, on August 22, 1812, the unique ruins of Petra were \"discovered\" by the Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Buckhardt.  The main goal of the explorer was to find the source of the Niger River. In England, in 1809, he supported Sir Joseph Box, president of the Royal Society and instrumental in promoting African exploration, to travel across the desert from Cairo. The researcher started attending Cambridge to study Arabic. Buckhardt becomes even more interested in the city when he hears of the death of another explorer who was searching for Petra. Then he bought a small hut in Syria and began to study the Arabic language, the Qur'an and Islam in depth. The researcher began to call himself Sheikh Ibrahim ibn Abdullah. Burckhardt traveled to Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine, paying protection money from local sheikhs and being robbed many times. Saying that he wanted to sacrifice a goat to Aaron, Burckhardt hired a local guide to take him to the ruins, where he was amazed to see the remains of ancient tombs and Roman mausoleums.    Burckhardt was sure it was Petra, but there he saw He could not stay because he was afraid of being known as an infidel who was looking for lost treasure and being attacked after him. He sacrificed the goat to Aaron and returned to Cairo that night. Burckhardt later traveled up the Nile and discovered the Temple of Ramses the Great with its colossal statues at Abu Simbel, made the pilgrimage to Mecca, and visited Medina. He died of dysentery in Cairo in 1817 at the age of 32. But he failed to reach his main goal, the Niger River...    Many discoveries were made in the decades that followed. For example, in 1993, Greek scrolls from the Byzantine period and satellite images discovered buried under the sands of the region.well-known monumental structures have also been identified as belonging to this city.    Currently, the city of Petra is recognized as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage and one of the seven new wonders of the world. Appropriate work is being done to protect this city from tourists, rain and other natural disasters and environmental factors.\",",
  "pisa_inorasi": "Leaning Tower of Pisa",
  "pisa_inorasi_desc": "The Leaning Tower of Pisa is known to almost every adult by its unique structure, because they talk about it in school. It is one of the most visited attractions in Italy. For many years, tourists were forbidden to enter the leaning building, but since the \"collapse\" was prevented, today those who wish can climb the bell tower and look at the opening view of the Garden of Miracles. Leaning Tower of Pisa in detail For those who do not know where the Leaning Tower is, it is worth visiting the city of Pisa. Attractive coordinates: 43 Â° 43'22 â³ s. sh. 10 Â° 23'47 â³ in. e. The bell tower is part of the Pisa Cathedral located in the Square of Miracles. Its ensemble includes:    Cathedral of Santa Maria;  Leaning Campanile;  Baptistry;  Cemetery of Santa Campo. Due to the slope, the height in meters differs from each side: the larger one is 56.7 m, the smaller one is 55.86 m, the diameter of the base is 15.5 meters. The bell weighs more than 14,000 tons. The angle of inclination today reaches 3 Â° 54 degrees.    The history of construction and its salvation ad  The history of the creation of the bell tower stretches back hundreds of years, because it was necessary to find solutions so that the structure would not lose its stability. The project of the future bell tower was created by Bozanno Pisano, who started construction in 1172. After two tiers of columns were built for the first floor and the following floors, the structure began to fall to one side. It turned out that the soil under the foundation on the southeast side was clayey, so it was eroded by groundwater. Work on the construction of the tower was stopped, and the master left the project unfinished. Later, the soil at the foundation was slightly strengthened, and in 1198 the building was even opened to visitors. Work on the bell tower was resumed in 1233, after 30 years marble was brought to decorate the facade. By the end of the XIII century, six floors of the Leaning Tower of Pisa had already been built, so the curved building began to stand out more against the background of other buildings, and the shift was 90 cm away from the axis. The entire fiftieth was built in the 14th century, then the eighth floor with a bell appeared. Despite how many years the tower was built, the official year of construction is not known. Some argue that it is 1350, others 1372. Many have questioned why the tower is tilted and even claim that it was originally intended to be. But the facts prove the opposite, because the soil indicators were not taken into account during the design of the structure. The foundation is very high, 3 meters deep, filled with rubble with soft soil. The bell tower does not come down only to this day, because the foundation is being strengthened. In the early 19th century, townspeople wondered when the great sign would come down after some of the land at the base was removed for aesthetic reasons. The structure began to move more and more violently, and for many it was a mystery how it was preserved. Active work on strengthening the foundation began at the beginning of the 20th century and continues to this day. First, the base was reinforced, making it waterproof with liquid cement, and then lead weights were attached to the concrete beams on the north side, which were supposed to stabilize the structure. The main work was done with soil: it was literally washed away little by little, and a screw cord was placed under the structure. As a result, the Leaning Tower of Pisa became what it is today, its angle of inclination has decreased by almost one and a half degree. would like to be classified as one of the ``wonders. It is made of marble, but the open arches in the Gothic style make the eight-story structure so airy that no photograph can convey its true beauty. The first floor of the Leaning Tower is deaf, and it is decorated with 15 semi-columned arches. Above the door is a 15th-century statue of Mary and Baid.   Six identical floors are attractive with their architecture. Each floor consists of 30 columns, which are outwardly empty, turning into an open visible arch, which makes the overall impression even lighter. The beautiful bell tower is decorated with paintings of mysterious animals. For those who are wondering how many bells are installed inside, it is worth saying that there are seven of them, and the largest one is called L'Assunta (Assumation). The campanile is no less interesting from the outside. Its walls are decorated with bas-relief paintings. Climbing the floors, you can visit the galleries of the tower, each of which hides its own secrets. The layout of the staircase leading to the bell tower is spiral; 294 steps lead to the top, their size is har decreases by one layer. The interior is just as impressive, as every detail has been painstakingly crafted. Leaning Tower of Pisa  There is an interesting story that explains why the Leaning Tower. According to him, the building was created by the master Pisano, it was elegant and elegant, it was raised correctly and nothing could spoil its appearance. After the work was completed, the architect appealed to the priests for payment, but they refused him. The master was upset, turned around and flew towards the tower: \\\"Follow me!\\\" As soon as he said these words, his creation, as if obeying, bowed behind the creator. Another myth is related to the works of Galileo Galilei. Some sources mention that the great scientist threw bodies of different masses from the bell tower to prove the law of universal attraction to the teachers of the University of Pisa. , Galileo's biography shows that his contributions to physics related to the oscillations of the pendulum were also related to the experiments carried out at the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Until now, this information is the cause of controversy in scientific circles, because some refer to it as fiction, while others refer to information of a biographical nature. The tilt is amazing about the tower  Historically, the design of the campanile is unstable, so it leans more and more towards the south every year. But, despite this, the famous bell tower was not damaged by the earthquakes that happened several times in the city of Tuscany. Interesting information also refers to the Fish Hall, on the wall of which there is a bas-relief of a creature that is a symbol of Christianity. There is no ceiling in this room, and tourists look up at the sky as if through a huge telescope.    Useful for tourists  Although the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889, interest in the Leaning Tower continues to this day. Tourists are still interested in why the bell tower was built, in which country it is located, why it never falls and why it leans. Catholics wanted to create a magnificent bell tower that could not be compared with any other mosque, and they managed to create a real miracle that paints its history in the photos of tourists every day. ad  The address of the bell tower is Piazza dei Miracoli, Pisa. It is not difficult to get to the square, but it is worth checking the opening hours in advance. They differ not according to the season, but according to the month, so when planning a vacation, you need to look at the work schedule. Entering the Garden of Wonders, you will not need to look for the Leaning Tower of Pisa, because it stands out from the general view due to its inclination.    During the tour, they will certainly give a brief history of the bell tower They tell how long it took for the bell tower to be built and why it is famous, but the most important thing is not to miss the opportunity to go up. Only at the top you can admire the surroundings and feel for yourself how the tower stands and what makes it special.",

Because of his powerful role as a god of the sea, he interacted directly with many Greek heroes as well as various other gods and goddesses. Poseidon's Origins  Poseidon was one of the children of the Titans Uranus and Rhea, along with Demeter, Hades, Hestia, Hera, and Chiron. Uranus feared the fulfillment of a prophecy that one of his children would overthrow him. To prevent fate, Uranus swallowed all his children. However, his son Zeus conspired with Rhea to overthrow Cronus. He freed his brothers, including Poseidon, by defeating Cronus.

Tyro soon gave birth to twin boys, Pelias and Neleus.  Poseidon had an affair with his granddaughter Alope, through whom he fathered the hero Hippothun.

The dead Amimon was being pursued by a wanton chthonic satyr who tried to rape him. Poseidon rescued her and together they had a child named Nauplius.  A woman named Caenis was kidnapped and raped by Poseidon. After that, Poseidon asked Cainis to grant him one wish. Caenis, disgusted and saddened, wanted to turn her into a man so as not to spoil her once more. In addition to giving her impenetrable skin, Poseidon also granted her wish. Later, Cainis was known as Cainis and became a minor Greek hero.  Poseidon raped Medusa in a temple dedicated to Athena. This angered Athena, who punished Medusa by turning her into a monster.

Athena offered the Athenians the olive tree, which provided them with firewood, oil, and food. Cecrops chose Athena's gift, and enraged at the loss, Poseidon sent a flood to the plains of Attica as punishment.    King Minos and Poseidon  To justify his new position as king of Crete, the dead Minos prayed to Poseidon for a sign. did Poseidon sent a giant white bull out of the sea, hoping that Minos would later sacrifice the bull.

Sometimes, in the imagination of the Egyptians Amon-Ra, he took the form of a woman and then called the beloved Amunet. especially for a long time, the city of Thebes is the capital of this god's travesty. Usually, he is depicted wearing at least royal robes decorated with feathers and a man, â in the form of a goose or a ram. a little less than anyone. The son of Geb, the god of the earth, and Nut, the god of the sky, he took his wife, the sister of Isis, the patroness of wealth, motherhood, health and sea travel (relatives were not prohibited in the family at that time). He inherited the title of supreme ruler, he taught the Egyptians to obey the laws of cultivating the land and respect their gods. Many difficulties and severe troubles happened. It all started with the fact that the deity Set desert, the incarnation of the evil inclination to kill him and the emperor will take place. His cunning plan, he understood very original.      Ancient Greek Gods in the modern world    Osiris, who was a mischievous person, announced that he would give this pearl to anyone who could sit comfortably in it. and invited a guest.

Heel, Gore Shis defeated and helped his mother resurrect his father.    OTHER POPULATION OF THE GODS OF ANCIENT EGYPT  Let us remember the names of some of the gods of the ancient world, lived on the banks of the Nile. It is all according to God's will. He and his wife Tefnut were the first inhabitants of heaven, created by the supreme god Atum, and marked the beginning of the division of the sexes. This deity was considered sunlight and air. His wife had the eyes of a female lion, he was depicted by a man dressed with a train.    The ancient world is the result of another deity, the sun, Ra became the supreme ruler. His image, as a man with the head of a falcon crowned with a sun disk, was often found on the walls of ancient Egyptian temples. A feature of RA is that his ability was produced daily by the sacred cow Nut and repeated all over again the next morning, to be given to the land of the dead, to have worked his way through the heavens.      The oldest gods of the world.     In addition to his wife Isis, Osiris had another sister named Nephthys, discussed above. She was not death, but the god of darkness and had the role of mistress of the kingdom of the dead in Egyptian mythology. It only appeared in the sunset and night sky on the way to steer his black boat from their underground goods. Her image can often be seen on the lid of a sarcophagus, where she appears in the form of a winged woman.    This is not a complete list of Egyptian gods Sekhmet, Bastet, Nepid, a Monch, Ptah, Hathor, Shesemu, Honshu, Goes by Heket and many other names. Each of them has its own history and its image printed on the walls of temples and shrines.    THE WORLD OF THE GODS IN ANCIENT GREECE  A very big step in the entire development of European culture.'Mystery became the ancient legend, its highest point was reached in the roar of ancient Hellas. The origin of the world and the gods in Ancient Greece, as well as in Egypt, it seems not accidental. whose place, in this case Zeus, is performed by the supreme creator, creating everything related. He became the king of all other gods, the Lord of Lightning and the embodiment of the boundless sky. Roman mythology, which became an extension of Greek, this image is equipped with these features and external features inherited from his grandfather, Jupiter. Hera, the wife of Zeus, was the goddess of motherhood and protection of women during pregnancy.    gods One characteristic feature of Greek gods is their elitism. Unlike the Egyptian legends, there were a total of 12 gods who lived on Mount Olympus in ancient Hellas and fell to earth only in an emergency. In this case, the situation of the other gods was much lower, and they played a middle role.    It is worth mentioning another characteristic feature of these Greek and Roman gods â they were accepted to be represented only in human form, giving perfection to each of their characteristics. done. The ancient gods of Greece are well known in today's world as their marble statues are unattainable models of ancient art. the representation of the two gods, ordered. One of them was Ares, who had a violent temper and indulged himself with hot fights with glasses. Zeus, his son, did not like him because he was only bloodlust and impatient about Olympus. Harmony was on the side of his daughter Athena â the goddess of fair war, wisdom and knowledge. Appeared on the battlefield, his brother TanrÄ±verdi was in extreme conflict. Roman mythology, it is suitable for Minerva.    heroes and gods in Ancient Greece, it is difficult to imagine the world without the god of the Muses, Apollo â sunlight, skillful healer and patron. His name became a household name, adding to the standard of male beauty, thanks to the images of the statue. A few centuries later, Apollo was embodied in the image of Phoebe to the Romans.

Despite the abundance of the most favorable suitors, it is curious that Hephaestus (he was called Vulcan to the Romans) â the God of blacksmithing, preferring hardworking and thrifty big men from the top of Mount Olympus.   \\in order not to offend the gods of the ancient world, read once on the coast of Greece, let us remember the patroness of the moon, fertility, hunting and female chastity, Artemis (Diana to the Romans), the dead, Sheol, the sea ( also known as Neptune) Poseidon and the crazy drunken god, the ruler of the Kingdom of God of wine and fun â Dionysos is better known by his Roman name Bacchus. year is increasing, a few lines are dedicated.

Since then, the world has moved to a new stage of development - the early Middle Ages. Gradually, the old life was forgotten, but not only the creator and the gods protect him.

  "rim_desc": "Rome, Ancient Rome - c. state. According to legend, the city of R. was founded by brothers Romulus and Remus in 754/753 BC. 7 kings who ruled in the 8th - 6th centuries are mentioned in the legends. After the expulsion of the last king, Tarquinius the Arrogant, a republic was established (510/509 BC). By the middle of the 3rd century BC, R. became a large state, subjugating the entire territory of Italy. He sought to become hegemonic in the Mediterranean basin, which caused R. to clash with Carthage. After the Punic Wars, R. won over Carthage in 146 BC and became the largest state in the Mediterranean basin. The development of large land ownership and slavery led to the destruction of the masses of peasants, the rise of the revolt of the rural poor and slaves (Spartacus revolt); There was a danger of a civil war breaking out in the streets of Rome. In the 1st century BC, the army and its leaders (L. K. Sulla, G. Marius, G. Pompei, etc.) began to play a major role in the socio-political life of R. During the civil war of 49-45, Caesar became the absolute ruler of the country; Caesar was killed as a result of the conspiracy of supporters of the republic in 44 years. A new era of civil war ended with the victory of Octavian. He received the title of Augustus from the senate in 27 BC. Since the reign of Augustus, R. has become an empire. During the reign of Trajan in the 2nd century AD, the borders of the empire reached its peak. Revolts of the local population in the occupied lands, and at the same time barbarian invasions of the country led to the independence of several provinces and the division of the empire into Eastern and Western parts (395). In 476, Odoacer, the commander of Germanic mercenaries, overthrew Romulus Augustulus, the last emperor of the Western Roman Empire. The Eastern Roman Empire existed under the name of Byzantium for another 1,000 years.      Education  Education and Maori f. Qad. children were brought up in the family. Primitive schools were established in the 5th century BC. Children are admitted to school from the age of 7 and are educated for 4-5 years. Latin, Greek, writing, reading, arithmetic were learned at home and at school. At first, children were taught in homes by hired teachers, and later a new system of education was formed in schools. Schools of grammar and rhetoric were established in the 60s of the 2nd century BC. Grammar schools for girls were established in the 1st century AD. Children aged 13-19 were taught in schools of rhetoric. These schools mainly taught public speaking. Law, philosophy, history, and poetry were taught in schools. Jurisprudential groups were formed from the 2nd century. During the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (2nd century), higher schools were established in Athens. Later, such schools were established in the western regions of Rome. During the republic, education was private, without state intervention, but during the empire, it was controlled. Teachers became civil servants and received salaries. From 362, teachers were approved by the emperor. Culture. R. went through complex stages of development from a city-state to a large Mediterranean state. Athens, Alexandria, Pergamum and other Greek scientific and cultural centers also became part of this state and were enriched by the influence of Etruscan, Greek, and Hellenistic cultures.    Religion and mythology  Kds. the Romans believed in many gods, they believed that there was a goddess, the divine patron of various things, such as water, springs, forests, trees, places and crops. These goddesses and patrons were initially depicted as faceless and later in human form under the influence of Etruscan and Greek religions. Sacrifices were made to them (for example, a cow was sacrificed to increase the harvest). People who believed in primitive religions worshiped in thickets, mountains, and fields (where mihrabs were built). The habit of building temples was passed on to the Romans from the Etruscans. Mars (first the god of fields and crops, later the god of war), Diana (the Greek goddess of Artemis; the goddess of the hunt), Venus (the goddess of the garden, fertility, later - Aphrodite - the goddess of love and beauty), Fortuna (the goddess of kismet), Feronia (the earth goddess) were considered the gods of the Italian peoples. Certain classes, certain professions looked at certain gods with more faith. For example, horsemen believed more in Neptune, merchants in Mercury, and slaves in Diana. Many religious traditions were spread under the influence of Greek culture. In the 3rd century BC, games were held every 100 years in honor of the gods of the underworld, and in honor of Saturn, the god of crops, a festival was held annually in December after field work. At the end of the 2nd century BC - in the 1st centuries, Isis (the ancient Egyptian goddess of fertility and motherhood), Osiris (ca.Eastern goddesses, such as the god of plants, the moon, the water of the Nile, and the king of the underworld) were also believed in. From the 1st century BC to the 1st century AD, the cult of the ruling and deified deceased emperors was introduced. In addition to the official gods, the slaves and the poor worshiped gods such as Pan (the patron of shepherds, the god of livestock), Silvan (the god of the forest, fields), who they considered to be the leaders of the spirit of work. Gradually, faith and trust in the gods of the East grew. In this way, R. religions were depressed, and at the end of the 4th century, the emperor Theodosius 1 banned various pagan traditions, thus the R. religions ended. The first period of R.'s philosophy is associated with the crisis of the polis ideology, during which thought was freed from religion and mythology (3rd-1st centuries BC). In the poem \"On the Nature of Things\" by Carus Lucretius (99-55 BC), he supported the teachings of Epicurus (342-270 BC), described atomistic materialism in a poetic form, emphasized that the universe, consisting of small particles - atoms, is always in motion. This work of his is in the development of materialism. became important. During the period when the empire was created (1st century BC - 1st century AD), the empire and the emperor's personality were deified, the philosophers of the 4th and 5th centuries promoted the works of Plato and Aristotle.    Natural - scientific views  R. There are very few monuments of Latin scientific literature of the period of the republic. Commentaries on Aristotle's works were created in the 1st century BC. At the end of the 1st century, interest in astronomy and mathematics increased. Ptolemy's famous Almagest (2nd century) described the geocentric system of the universe. Astrology is widespread in the East. \"Arithmetic\" by Diaphantus (around the 3rd century) and \"Collection of Mathematics\" by Papp Alexandrisky in the 3rd-4th centuries were popular. Scientific and technical literature was mainly devoted to agriculture, veterinary medicine, and military equipment. At the end of the 1st century BC, Vitruvius' work \"10 books on architecture\" became famous. Rich experience in the field of military equipment: the issues of building camps and fortresses were covered in the literature. Botany developed in connection with medicine. Dioscorides' description of 600 medicinal plants was widely used in the Middle Ages. Doctor, anatomist, physiologist Galen played a major role in the development of medicine throughout Europe. Scientific literature is also notable for its interesting and artistic writing. The territorial growth of the R. state in the 3rd-1st centuries BC geogr. allowed the development of knowledge. During the reign of Emperor Augustus, a large geographical map of the world was created. In 37 BC, 1 public library was established, and in the last century of the empire, their number reached 28.    Law    Ancient Rome. Cicero condemns Catiline. Photo by Cesare Maccari  Jurisprudence. In ancient R., in the 3rd century BC and 3rd century AD, law developed widely, and jurists played a major role in creating laws. In the 1st-3rd centuries, there was a struggle between 2 schools of law, which reflected the views of different social classes - the supporters of the republic system and the supporters of the principality. From August onwards, the emperors gave the major jurists a decisive vote and entrusted legal consultations to them. These jurists, who were in the service of the emperor, in turn protected the unlimited rights of the emperors (see also Roman law). Around 130 BC, the annals, consisting of 80 books, were compiled under the name \"Great Annals\". The first historians were called annalists. The first accomplished historian, Polybius (2nd century BC), produced a 40-book history of Greece, Macedonia, Asia Minor, Syria, Carthage, and Rome. Titus Livy's \"History of Rome\", Julius Caesar's books on the Gallic Wars, civil war, numerous biographical works of generals such as Saliustius, Cornelius Nepotus (1st century BC) are known. During the imperial period, Cornelius Tacitus (beginning of the 1st-2nd centuries) created works called \"Annals\" and \"History\" (events from the death of Augustus to the death of Domitian, from 14 to 96 AD) in an artistic and didactic spirit. At the beginning of the 2nd century, the historical-biographical genre developed. Plutarch, the Suetonians who were the secretary of Emperor Hadrian, created biographies of famous people. Among the Greek historians, Appian (2nd half of the 2nd century) wrote the history of the civil war in Rome, Dion Cassius cad. created the history of R. from the times to 229 years. The last great historian of antiquity, Ammianus Marcellinus (4th century), is best known for his works on the history of the reign of Emperor Julian. Christian historiography appeared in the last period of the empire.    Literature  The oldest of Rome. samples (5th-4th centuries BC) sanot left According to later information, poetry (prayer, wedding songs, laments) took the main place in those times. From the end of the 2nd century BC, the first works of R.'s lyrics appeared. The comedies of Plautus and Terentius have been fully preserved from the works created during this period. Cicero's work played an important role in the formation of R.'s literary style. Lucretius and Catullus were known for their poems on love and friendship. During the period of the rise and fall of the empire (1st-3rd centuries), Roman culture developed parallel to Greek culture, but independently. During this period, Ovid made a significant contribution to the development of Russian literature with such immortal works as \"The Science of Love\", \"Metamorphoses\". Literature is enriched with new styles. Christian literature developed in the 4th-5th centuries.    Theatr  The emergence of the art of theater is connected with harvest festivals. Around 33 BC, folk comic shows appeared. Such shows, atellanas, often consist of 4 permanent characters, initially performed by young people wearing masks, and later by professional artists. In 240 BC, the first dramas based on Greek originals, later tragedies and comedies by Greek authors were staged. At the beginning of the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, plays depicting the lives of the citizens of R. belonging to different classes began to be shown. The first stone theater building was built in 55-52 BC. The artists consisted of freedmen and slaves and were organized into troupes. Men also played female roles. In the last century of the republic, the tragic actor Aesop and the comic actor Rossiy gained fame. In the 1st and 2nd centuries, dances were staged, and performances related to political events began to be shown. Little by little, small household scenes turned into performances with a complex plot. Shows in circuses, battles of gladiators in amphitheatres, along with hunters fighting with animals, scenes of mass hunting, sea battles and others began to be shown. During the Empire period, instead of artistic dramas, there was an increased appetite for bloodshed spectacles. R.'s theater, especially its dramaturgy, made a great contribution to the development of world theater and dramaturgy.    Music  R.'s music, developed under the influence of Hellenistic culture, contained solemn (concerned with victory), wedding, banquet, and religious ceremony songs. During the empire, performers from many countries (Greek, Syrian and Babylonian musicians, Alexandrian singers, Andalusian dancers, etc.) gathered in the capital.

Military legions had brass bands. Competitions of poets, singers and musicians were held.    Architecture  Roman fine and practical decorative art is the last, concluding period of ancient artistic culture. In R., realism increased in the art of architecture, sculpture and painting, historical figures and events were depicted more often than legends (myths) as in Greek art. Art of R. the influence of Etruscan art became strong. In the art of the Punic Wars and the late Republican period (31st century BC), it flourished in harmony with the art of Greater Greece (Southern Italy) and the eastern Greek cities conquered by the Romans. Buildings were built grandiosely, residences began to be built closer to nature (especially villas outside the city), concrete was used from the 2nd century BC, which allowed buildings to be built cheaply and quickly, and their forms varied. In the 2nd-1st centuries BC, auditoriums and theaters were improved, the audience seating areas were separated from the stage and performance area by galleries, stairs.    Portrait sculpture flourished in the fine arts in the 3rd-1st centuries BC, cities were decorated with statues of officials and heroes. decorated. During the period of the republic, reliefs on historical subjects were worked on a lot, monumental decorative painting, mosaics, art of artistic processing of precious stones rose. The high development of the architecture of ancient R. corresponds to the period when the empire flourished. Emphasis was placed on the monumentality of buildings (arches, hilly, domed buildings), buildings were made attractive by works of sculpture and painting. The architecture served to glorify the emperor's personality and display the power of the empire. In the middle of the 1st century, the palaces were built very luxuriously. Magnificent buildings such as the Pantheon with a huge dome, large amphitheatreswas created. Among the emperors, during the time of Trajan, heroism was more expressed in the statues, while during the reigns of Hadrian and Antony, psychological depth was highlighted in the images. In decorative painting, light patterns, paintings with small plots were given more importance (until 63), then complex architectural compositions were displayed more. From the 2nd century onwards, stone mosaic became widespread. In the period of the empire, artistic metalworking, red glaze pottery and glassware production flourished in practical decorative arts. During the period when the empire was in decline (3rd-4th centuries), many new forums and large temples were built in the regions. Ancient R. traditions were developed in R. constructions. Conditionality began to take a wide place in sculpture. In the 3rd-4th centuries, the art of making miniature portraits (made of thin paper and placed between 2 layers of glass) and marble sarcophagi decorated with reliefs depicting Christian legends developed.",

The Sphinx is located southeast of the pyramids. Although the exact date of its construction is unknown, the general agreement among Egyptologists is that the head of the Great Sphinx resembles the pharaoh Khafra, between 2600 and 2500 BC. However, a fringe minority of geologists in the late 20th century claimed evidence of water erosion in and around the Sphinx's enclosure, proving that the Sphinx was once there.

In addition to the Great Sphinx, other famous sphinxes of Egypt include the head of the pharaoh Hatshepsut, a carved granite likeness of which is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the alabaster Sphinx of Memphis, which is now housed in an open-air museum on this site.

However, historian Susan Wise Bauer suggests that the word \"sphinx\" was instead a corruption of the Greek name \"shesepankh\", meaning \"living image\". the statue is of the sphinx carved from \"living stone\" (stone from the construction site, not collected and brought from elsewhere), not the animal itself. and describes the wings of a bird.[9] Pliny the Elder mentions the production of many sphinxes with brown hair and breasts in Ethiopia.[10] Statius describes him as a winged beast, with soft cheeks, eyes sunk in corruption, sluices covered with snow, and talons in his lively hands.[11] Sometimes, the wings are marked as the wings of an eagle and the tail should be a snake - the head.

This second riddle is also found in the Gascon version of the legend and may be very ancient.[19]    Finally, the Sphinx died by throwing herself from the best stone[20]; or, in some versions, Oedipus killed him[21]. An alternative version says that he swallowed himself[citation needed]. In both cases, Oedipus can be recognized as a \"liminal\" or liminal indicator that affects the transition between old religious traditions represented by the death of the Sphinx and the emergence of new ones, the Olympian gods[citation needed].    The Riddle in Popular Culture  In Jean Cocteau's retelling of the Oedipus myth, The Infernal Machine, the Sphinx told Oedipus the answer to the riddle to kill himself, now that he should not kill, but also to love him . He leaves without ever thanking him for giving him the answer to the riddle. The scene ends when the Sphinx and Anubis ascend to heaven.    There are mythic, anthropological, psychoanalytic, and parodic interpretations of the riddle of the Sphinx and Oedipus' answer to it. The Riddle of the Sphinx by Sigmund Freud as \"the question of where babies come from\".[22]    Many riddle books use the Sphinx in their titles or illustrations.[23]    Michael Mayer, in his book Atalanta Fugiens (1617)[24] writes the following commentary on the Riddle of the Sphinx, the solution of which is Philosopher's Stone:    The Sphinx is reported to have indeed contained many riddles, but this to Oedipus: \\\"On four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and what is that thing that walks on three legs in the evening?\" It is not known what Oedipus answered. But those who interpret the ages of mankind are deceived. For the quadrilateral of the four elements, everything must first be considered, from which we come to the hemisphere with the right and curved lines, that is, the two lines towards the White Luna; thence to the Triangle of Body, Soul, and Soul, or Sol, Luna, and Mercury. Therefore Rhasis says in his Epistles that the \"Stone\" is \"triangular in essence, square in quality.\"",

In the 2007 elections, Assad won 97.6% of the vote. From 1963 to 2011, Syria was under a state of emergency, which gave the president emergency powers; Although the state of emergency was officially lifted today, civil liberties are restricted.    In addition to the president, Syria has two vice presidents, one in charge of foreign policy and the other in charge of foreign policy. The 250-seat legislature, or Majlis al-Shaab, is elected by popular vote for four-year terms.    The president serves as chairman of Syria's Supreme Judicial Council. It also appoints the members of the Supreme Constitutional Court, which oversees elections and rules on the constitutionality of laws. There are judges' courts of first instance, as well as courts of personal circumstances that use Sharia law to govern marriage and divorce cases.

'lgan Kurt ; Armenian, which is Indo-European in the Greek branch; Aramaic, another Semitic language; and Cherkasy, a Caucasian language.    In addition to these native languages, many Syrians can speak French. After World War I, France was the mandating power in Syria.    Also, English is popularly spoken internationally in Syria.    Population  Syria has a population of 22.5 million (2012 estimate). 90% of them are Arab, 9% are Bori, and the rest are Armenians, Circassians and Turkmens. In addition, there are about 18,000 Israeli citizens occupying the Golan Heights.    Syria's population is growing rapidly, with an annual growth rate of 2.4 percent. The average life expectancy for men is 69.8 years and for women is 72.7 years.    Religion in Syria  Syria is home to a complex religion that manifests itself among its citizens. About 74 percent of Syrians are Sunni Muslims. Another 12% (including the Assad family) are Alawites or Alawites from twelve schools of Shia sect. About 10% are Christians, mainly the Antiochian Orthodox Church, but also Armenian Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, and the Eastern Assyrian Church.    About three percent of Syrians are Druze; this unique faith combines the Shia faith of the Ismaili school with Greek philosophy and Gnosticism. Syrians are a minority of Jews or Jews. Yazidism is mainly among ethnic Kurds who combine Zoroastrianism and Islamic mysticism.    Geography  Syria is located in the eastern Mediterranean. It has an area of 185,180 square kilometers (71,500 sq mi) and is divided into fourteen administrative units.    Syria is bordered by Turkey to the north and west, Iraq to the east, Jordan and Israel to the south, bordering Lebanon in the west. Although much of Syria is desert, 28 percent of it is irrigated by the Euphrates River, covering most of it.    Syria's highest point, Mount Hermon, is 2,814 meters (9,232 ft). is The lowest point is near the Sea of Galilee, 200 meters above sea level (-656 feet).    Climate  Syria's climate varies widely, with a semiarid zone between the relatively humid coast and desert interior. While the coast averages around 27 Â°C in August, temperatures in the desert regularly exceed 45 Â°C (113 Â°F).    Similarly, rain across the Mediterranean 750 to 1,000 mm (30-40 inches) per year, while the desert receives only 250 millimeters (10 inches). Although the country has increased to a moderate level, economic uncertainty has occurred in Syria due to political instability and international sanctions. This depends on agriculture and oil exports, both of which are declining. Corruption is also a problem, and agriculture and oil exports are both declining. Corruption is also an issue.    About 17 percent of Syrian workers work in agriculture, 16 percent in industry, and 67 percent in services. The unemployment rate is 8.1 percent, and 11.9 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. Syria's GDP per capita was approximately US$5,100 in 2011.    US$1 = 63.75 Syrian pounds as of June 2012.    History of Syria  Syria The beginning of Neolithic human culture 12000 years agowas one of the centers of bki. Important advances in agriculture, such as the development of domesticated grain varieties and the domestication of livestock, may have occurred in the Levant, which would include Syria.    About mil. Avv. By 3000 BC, the Syrian city of Ebla was the capital of a large Semitic empire with trade links with Sumer, Akkad, and even Egypt. However, the invasions of the Sea Peoples destroyed this culture. Avv. It stopped in the second millennium.    During the Achamid period (550-336 BC), Syria came under Persian rule, and the Macedonians, who defeated Persia in the Battle of Gaugamela (331 BC), fell before the Macedonians.  \\ During the next three centuries, Syria was ruled by the Seleucids, the Romans, the Byzantines, and the Armenians. Finally, mil. Avv. It became a Roman province in 64 AD and became known as the capital Damascus in 636 AD, after the establishment of the Muslim Imamate in Syria. When the Abbasid Empire was displaced by the Umayyads in 750, the new rulers moved the capital of the Islamic world to Baghdad.    Byzantium (Eastern Rome) tried to reassert control over Syria, between 960 and 1020 it captured one of Syria's major cities. how many times he attacked, won and lost. By the time the Seljuk Turks conquered Byzantium in the late 13th century, Byzantine aspirations waned and they conquered parts of Syria. At the same time, European Christians began to establish small crusader states on the Syrian coast. They were opposed by warriors, including the famous Saladin, the sultan of Syria and Egypt. faced threats in the form of expansion. The Moldavian embassies invaded Syria and faced stiff resistance from opponents who opposed the Egyptian Mamluk army, which defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260. Enemies fought until 1322, but at this time, the Mongol army converted to Islam in the Middle East and became the culture of the region. The Enlightenment abdicated in the mid-14th century, and the Mamluk Sultanate consolidated its position in the region.    In 1516, a new power gained control of Syria. The Ottoman Empire, based in Turkey, ruled Syria and the rest of the Levant until 1918. Syria became a relatively undervalued reservoir in the vast Ottoman territory.    The Ottoman sultan made the mistake of allying himself with the Germans and Austrian magnates in World War I; When they gave up the war, the Ottoman Empire, also known as the \"doctor of Europe\", fell apart. Under the control of the new League of Nations, Great Britain and France divided the former Ottoman lands between themselves in the Middle East. Syria and Lebanon became a French mandate.    A revolt by the united Syrian people against the colonialists in 1925 frightened France so much that they used brutal methods to put down the rebellion. In a foreshadowing of French policy decades later in Vietnam, French troops chased tanks out of Syrian cities, rammed homes, executed suspected insurgents and even bombed civilians from the air.    During World War II, The French government declared the independence of Syria from Vichy France and assumed the right to veto a bill passed by the new Syrian legislature. The last French troops left Syria in April 1946, and the country achieved true independence.    Syrian politics in the 1950s and early 1960s were bloody and chaotic. In 1963, a coup brought the Baath Party to power; remains under control until now. Hafez al-Assad won both the party and the country in the 1970s, and after the death of President Hafez al-Assad in 2000, President Bashar al-Assad took over.    The young Assad was seen as a reformer and modernizer. but his regime was broken and brutally proved. Since the spring of 2011, the Syrian rebellion has attempted to overthrow Assad as part of the Arab Spring movement.\",",
  "tauer": "Tower Bridge",
  "tauer_desc": "Tower Bridge is a suspension bridge in London built between 1886 and 1894. Designed by architect Horace Jones. Henry Mark Brunel, John Wolf Barry helped him in the bridge project. It was built on the Thames River. The bridge is a unique masterpiece of the 19th century. Built to provide better transport links to East London. The bridge was officially opened on June 30, 1894 by Edward, Prince of Wales and Alexandra, Princess of Wales. Tower Bridge is one of the famous landmarks of London. It is sometimes confused with London Bridge, which is approximately 0.80 km above the Tower. Description  The bridge consists of two horizontal walkways, 240 m long and 65 m long. Ships can easily travel under the bridge, that is, from the water. The bridge is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, and together with the bridge's twin towers, walkways at the top and the Victorian engine room, it forms the whole of Tower Bridge. At the end of the 19th century, East London saw a boom in trade, and the new river downstream of London Bridge hindered trade. This created a demand for a new bridge. A traditional fixed bridge over the Thames could not be built as it would have blocked the traffic of ships sailing to the port facilities in London.    History    Construction in 1892  In 1877 a committee was formed specifically for the bridge, chaired by Albert Joseph Altman, to find a solution. More than fifty designs, including those submitted by civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette, were rejected. The project was not approved until 1884, when it was decided to build a suspension bridge. John Wolfe Barry was appointed engineer and Horace Jones was appointed architect for the suspension bridge (he was also one of the committee appointed to build the bridge). The act of parliament authorizing the construction was passed in 1885. As indicated in it, the opening for the movement of ships was required to have a span of 61 meters and a height of 41 meters. It was appropriate to have a design in the Gothic style. The construction was funded by the Bridge House Estates, a charity founded in 1282 to repair London Bridge, which later expanded not only to Tower Bridge, but also to Blackfriars Bridge, Southwark Bridge and Millennium Bridge. Construction began on June 21, 1886 with the laying of the foundation stone by the Prince of Wales and lasted eight years. Major contractors included John Jackson for foundations, Armstrong, Mitchell and Kompany for hydraulics, and Crutwell as resident engineer in charge of construction. 71,123 t of concrete began to rise from the riverbed for construction. 11,177 tons of concrete were used for towers and pavements. After Jones died in 1887, his partner George D. Stevenson took over the project. Stevenson replaced Jones's brick design with a more elegant Victorian Gothic style. This made the bridge a landmark in its own right, and a plan to harmonize the bridge with the nearby Tower of London came to fruition. The total cost of construction was Â£1,184,000. The opening ceremony took place in 1894. The ceremony was attended by Lord Chamberlain, Lord Carrington and Home Secretary H.H. Asquith. An Act of Parliament specified that there should be a special station to assist ships in distress crossing the bridge, a requirement that remained in place until the 1960s.    Functions  The bridge connected an iron gate on the north bank of the river with Horseliddown Road to the south - now respectively Tower Bridge Gate. and is called Tower Bridge Road. Before the bridge was opened, the Tower Underground was the shortest way to cross the river. Opened in 1870, the Tower Subway was one of the world's first underground (\"tube\") railways, but it closed after just three months. It was later reopened as a toll pedestrian tunnel. After the Tower Bridge opened, most pedestrians switched to using the bridge, as there was no toll to cross like the tunnel. The tunnel, which lost much of its revenue once the bridge was operational, was closed in 1898.    During World War II    Tower Bridge - 1950  During World War II, Tower Bridge was seen as the main transport link to the Port of London and therefore a target for enemy activity. . In 1940, as a result of the bombardment of the city by the Nazis, the bridge was directly hit, causing great damage to the hydraulic mechanism. In 1942, the existing engines were damaged by enemy action, so a third engine was installed. In 1982, the Tower Bridge Exhibition opened.Eastern goddesses, such as the god of plants, the moon, the water of the Nile, and the king of the underworld) were also believed in. From the 1st century BC to the 1st century AD, the cult of the ruling and deified deceased emperors was introduced. In addition to the official gods, the slaves and the poor worshiped gods such as Pan (the patron of shepherds, the god of livestock), Silvan (the god of the forest, fields), who they considered to be the leaders of the spirit of work. Gradually, faith and trust in the gods of the East grew. In this way, R. religions were depressed, and at the end of the 4th century, the emperor Theodosius 1 banned various pagan traditions, thus the R. religions ended. The first period of R.'s philosophy is associated with the crisis of the polis ideology, during which thought was freed from religion and mythology (3rd-1st centuries BC). In the poem \"On the Nature of Things\" by Carus Lucretius (99-55 BC), he supported the teachings of Epicurus (342-270 BC), described atomistic materialism in a poetic form, emphasized that the universe, consisting of small particles - atoms, is always in motion. This work of his is in the development of materialism. became important. During the period when the empire was created (1st century BC - 1st century AD), the empire and the emperor's personality were deified, the philosophers of the 4th and 5th centuries promoted the works of Plato and Aristotle.    Natural - scientific views  R. There are very few monuments of Latin scientific literature of the period of the republic. Commentaries on Aristotle's works were created in the 1st century BC. At the end of the 1st century, interest in astronomy and mathematics increased. Ptolemy's famous Almagest (2nd century) described the geocentric system of the universe. Astrology is widespread in the East. \"Arithmetic\" by Diaphantus (around the 3rd century) and \"Collection of Mathematics\" by Papp Alexandrisky in the 3rd-4th centuries were popular. Scientific and technical literature was mainly devoted to agriculture, veterinary medicine, and military equipment. At the end of the 1st century BC, Vitruvius' work \"10 books on architecture\" became famous. Rich experience in the field of military equipment: the issues of building camps and fortresses were covered in the literature. Botany developed in connection with medicine. Dioscorides' description of 600 medicinal plants was widely used in the Middle Ages. Doctor, anatomist, physiologist Galen played a major role in the development of medicine throughout Europe. Scientific literature is also notable for its interesting and artistic writing. The territorial growth of the R. state in the 3rd-1st centuries BC geogr. allowed the development of knowledge. During the reign of Emperor Augustus, a large geographical map of the world was created. In 37 BC, 1 public library was established, and in the last century of the empire, their number reached 28.    Law    Ancient Rome. Cicero condemns Catiline. Photo by Cesare Maccari  Jurisprudence. In ancient R., in the 3rd century BC and 3rd century AD, law developed widely, and jurists played a major role in creating laws. In the 1st-3rd centuries, there was a struggle between 2 schools of law, which reflected the views of different social classes - the supporters of the republic system and the supporters of the principality. From August onwards, the emperors gave the major jurists a decisive vote and entrusted legal consultations to them. These jurists, who were in the service of the emperor, in turn protected the unlimited rights of the emperors (see also Roman law). Around 130 BC, the annals, consisting of 80 books, were compiled under the name \"Great Annals\". The first historians were called annalists. The first accomplished historian, Polybius (2nd century BC), produced a 40-book history of Greece, Macedonia, Asia Minor, Syria, Carthage, and Rome. Titus Livy's \"History of Rome\", Julius Caesar's books on the Gallic Wars, civil war, numerous biographical works of generals such as Saliustius, Cornelius Nepotus (1st century BC) are known. During the imperial period, Cornelius Tacitus (beginning of the 1st-2nd centuries) created works called \"Annals\" and \"History\" (events from the death of Augustus to the death of Domitian, from 14 to 96 AD) in an artistic and didactic spirit. At the beginning of the 2nd century, the historical-biographical genre developed. Plutarch, the Suetonians who were the secretary of Emperor Hadrian, created biographies of famous people. Among the Greek historians, Appian (2nd half of the 2nd century) wrote the history of the civil war in Rome, Dion Cassius cad. created the history of R. from the times to 229 years. The last great historian of antiquity, Ammianus Marcellinus (4th century), is best known for his works on the history of the reign of Emperor Julian. Christian historiography appeared in the last period of the empire.    Literature  The oldest of Rome. samples (5th-4th centuries BC) sanot left According to later information, poetry (prayer, wedding songs, laments) took the main place in those times. From the end of the 2nd century BC, the first works of R.'s lyrics appeared. The comedies of Plautus and Terentius have been fully preserved from the works created during this period. Cicero's work played an important role in the formation of R.'s literary style. Lucretius and Catullus were known for their poems on love and friendship. During the period of the rise and fall of the empire (1st-3rd centuries), Roman culture developed parallel to Greek culture, but independently. During this period, Ovid made a significant contribution to the development of Russian literature with such immortal works as \"The Science of Love\", \"Metamorphoses\". Literature is enriched with new styles. Christian literature developed in the 4th-5th centuries.    Theatr  The emergence of the art of theater is connected with harvest festivals. Around 33 BC, folk comic shows appeared. Such shows, atellanas, often consist of 4 permanent characters, initially performed by young people wearing masks, and later by professional artists. In 240 BC, the first dramas based on Greek originals, later tragedies and comedies by Greek authors were staged. At the beginning of the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, plays depicting the lives of the citizens of R. belonging to different classes began to be shown. The first stone theater building was built in 55-52 BC. The artists consisted of freedmen and slaves and were organized into troupes. Men also played female roles. In the last century of the republic, the tragic actor Aesop and the comic actor Rossiy gained fame. In the 1st and 2nd centuries, dances were staged, and performances related to political events began to be shown. Little by little, small household scenes turned into performances with a complex plot. Shows in circuses, battles of gladiators in amphitheatres, along with hunters fighting with animals, scenes of mass hunting, sea battles and others began to be shown. During the Empire period, instead of artistic dramas, there was an increased appetite for bloodshed spectacles. R.'s theater, especially its dramaturgy, made a great contribution to the development of world theater and dramaturgy.    Music  R.'s music, developed under the influence of Hellenistic culture, contained solemn (concerned with victory), wedding, banquet, and religious ceremony songs. During the empire, performers from many countries (Greek, Syrian and Babylonian musicians, Alexandrian singers, Andalusian dancers, etc.) gathered in the capital. In R. wind instruments, tibia (lat. avlos), buksina, tuba, etc., string instruments, kifara, harp-type psaltery trigonon (triangular harp), sambika, barbitos, pectis, magadis, lyre types, kimvol, etc., from percussion instruments, as well as hydraulics was Qad. Theater genre - pantomime played an important role in the development of R.'s instrumental music. Circus and theater actors performed accompanied by large choral ensembles and orchestras. Military legions had brass bands. Competitions of poets, singers and musicians were held.    Architecture  Roman fine and practical decorative art is the last, concluding period of ancient artistic culture. In R., realism increased in the art of architecture, sculpture and painting, historical figures and events were depicted more often than legends (myths) as in Greek art. Art of R. the influence of Etruscan art became strong. In the art of the Punic Wars and the late Republican period (31st century BC), it flourished in harmony with the art of Greater Greece (Southern Italy) and the eastern Greek cities conquered by the Romans. Buildings were built grandiosely, residences began to be built closer to nature (especially villas outside the city), concrete was used from the 2nd century BC, which allowed buildings to be built cheaply and quickly, and their forms varied. In the 2nd-1st centuries BC, auditoriums and theaters were improved, the audience seating areas were separated from the stage and performance area by galleries, stairs.    Portrait sculpture flourished in the fine arts in the 3rd-1st centuries BC, cities were decorated with statues of officials and heroes. decorated. During the period of the republic, reliefs on historical subjects were worked on a lot, monumental decorative painting, mosaics, art of artistic processing of precious stones rose. The high development of the architecture of ancient R. corresponds to the period when the empire flourished. Emphasis was placed on the monumentality of buildings (arches, hilly, domed buildings), buildings were made attractive by works of sculpture and painting. The architecture served to glorify the emperor's personality and display the power of the empire. In the middle of the 1st century, the palaces were built very luxuriously. Magnificent buildings such as the Pantheon with a huge dome, large amphitheatreswas created. Among the emperors, during the time of Trajan, heroism was more expressed in the statues, while during the reigns of Hadrian and Antony, psychological depth was highlighted in the images. In decorative painting, light patterns, paintings with small plots were given more importance (until 63), then complex architectural compositions were displayed more. From the 2nd century onwards, stone mosaic became widespread. In the period of the empire, artistic metalworking, red glaze pottery and glassware production flourished in practical decorative arts. During the period when the empire was in decline (3rd-4th centuries), many new forums and large temples were built in the regions. Ancient R. traditions were developed in R. constructions. Conditionality began to take a wide place in sculpture. In the 3rd-4th centuries, the art of making miniature portraits (made of thin paper and placed between 2 layers of glass) and marble sarcophagi decorated with reliefs depicting Christian legends developed.",
  "tibbiyot": "Medicine in Rome",
  "tibbiyot_desc": "Ancient Roman medicine was greatly influenced by ancient Greek medicine, but through knowledge of Hippocratic medicine, new practices were developed along with diet, regimen, and surgical procedures. This was especially seen in the works of Dioscorides and Galen, two famous Greek physicians who practiced medicine and recorded their discoveries. This is in contrast to the opinions of two other physicians, Soran of Ephesus and Asclepiades of Bithynia, who later practiced medicine both elsewhere and in ancient Rome. Dioscorides was a doctor in the Roman army, Soran was a representative of the methodical school of medicine, Galen held public demonstrations, and Asclepiades was a leading Roman physician. All four of these physicians had knowledge of medicine, diseases, and treatments that were curative, lasting, and influential throughout human history.    Ancient Roman medicine was divided into specialties such as ophthalmology and urology. In order to increase their knowledge of the human body, physicians used various surgical procedures for dissection, which were performed using various instruments such as forceps, scalpels, and catheters.    Introduction  The Roman Empire was a complex and powerful combination of Greek and Roman cultural elements[1]. Later Latin authors, notably Cato and Pliny, believed in a specific traditional Roman form of healing readily available through herbs, songs, prayers, and household items.[2]    Two. Greek medicine was introduced into Italy with the establishment and development of military and political ties between the region.[3] It was not until the introduction of the healing god Asclepius in 291 BC and the arrival of the Greek physician Archagatus[4] in 219 BC that foreign medicine became popular in Rome, largely due to general adaptation to Roman practice in the future.[5]  \\ Leaving aside the wider implications of Greek influence on Roman society, the influence of ancient Greek medicine, ethnography, and meteorology was particularly significant in two areas: architecture and public health. This was very important from the point of view of the Roman army[6], which had many medical advances. The medical department was established, [6] permanent doctors were appointed, valetudinaria (military hospitals) were established, and the first traces of systematic care for the wounded appeared during Caesar's time. The variety and nature of surgical instruments found in Roman remains suggests a good knowledge of surgery.[7]    Roman Medicine  Roman medicine was greatly influenced by Greek medical traditions. Before Greek medicine, Roman medicine was influenced by religion and magic. The first Roman physicians were religious figures who were not medically trained or heads of families.[8] The first professional doctors were Greek doctors. Asclepiades of Bithynia came to Rome in 124 BC. He was a physician known for his kindness to his patients, and often prescribed wine, rest, and the rocking couch.[8] The incorporation of Greek medicine into Roman society allowed Rome to become monumental.[9] Roman physicians relied on naturalistic observations rather than spiritual rituals, as did Greek physicians; but this does not mean that there is no spiritual belief. Tragic famines and plagues were often attributed to divine punishment; and propitiating the gods through rituals was believed to alleviate such occurrences. Miasma was believed to be the root cause of many diseases caused by famine, wars or plague. The concept of contagiousness was formulated, resulting in quarantine practices and improved sanitation.[10] The Romans established systems of public hygiene, realizing that this was important for public health. This can be seen in their practice of burying the dead outside the city walls, and in their large water supply through aqueducts, public baths, and public sewage systems. They also began to drain the swamps near the cities.[8]    One of the first prominent physicians in Rome was Galen. He became an expert on human anatomy by dissecting animals, including monkeys, in Greece.[11] Due to his popularity and experience in ancient Rome, Galen became the personal physician of the emperor Marcus Aurelius.[11]      Caduceus of Mercury ; Stadtmuseum Rapperswil-Jona, Rapperswil, Switzerland  In 46 BC, Julius Caesar granted Roman citizenship to doctors when the Roman army needed skilled surgeons.[8] In 30 BC, the Romans conquered Alexandria, an important center of learning whose Great Library contained countless ancient Greek medical records.[12] The Romans adopted many of the practices and procedures found in the Great Librarys. In 10 AD, Augustus granted tax relief to doctors working in Rome, and also excluded them from public duties.[8] These concessions led to an influx of uneducated and unqualified doctors to Rome, which provided tax breaks to only a select number of state doctors in each region.[8]    Greek symbols and gods greatly influenced ancient Roman medicine. gave The caduceus, a staff entwined with two serpents, was originally associated with Hermes, the Greek god of commerce.[13] This symbol was later associated with the Roman god Mercury. Later, in the 7th century, the caduceus became associated with health and medicine due to its association with Nitrogen, the alchemical \"universal solvent\".[14]    Galen    A group of physicians in a depiction from Dioscurides of Vienna; Galen is depicted in the top center.  Galen of Pergamon (129 BC - 216 AD)[15] was a prominent Greek physician[16] whose theories dominated Western medicine for more than a millennium. At the age of 20, he served four years as a therapist (\\\"supervisor\\\" or \\\"associate\\\") of Asclepius at the local temple. Although Galen studied the human body, it was against Roman law to dissect human corpses, so he used pigs, monkeys, sheep, goats, and other animals. By studying animal decomposition, Galen applied his findings on animal anatomy and developed a theory of human anatomy.[17]    Galen moved to Rome in 162. There he lectured, wrote extensively, and demonstrated his anatomical knowledge in public. He soon gained a reputation as an experienced doctor, attracting many patients to his practice. Among them was the consul Flavius Boethius, who introduced him to the imperial court, where he became the physician of the emperor Marcus Aurelius. Despite being a member of the court, Galen abandoned Latin and preferred to speak and write in his native Greek. He dealt with Roman emperors Lucius Verus, Commodus and Septimius Severus. In 166, Galen returned to Pergamon, but returned to Rome for good in 169.    Galen followed Hippocrates' theory of the four humors and believed that human health was determined by the four main bodily fluids (blood, bile, believed to depend on the balance between bile and phlegm). Food was believed to be the first object to stabilize humors. In contrast, drugs, venesection, cautery, and surgery were drastic and should only be used when diet and regimen failed.[18] The survival and transformation of Hippocratic medicine is attributed to Galen, who combined the four qualities of cold, heat, dry, and wet with the four basic fluids of the body, remaining in the field of health care for thousands of years to come. .[5]    Asclepiads    Bust of Asclepiads  Asclepiads studied medicine in Alexandria and practiced medicine in Asia Minor as well as Greece before moving to Rome in the 1st century BC. His knowledge of medicine allowed him to flourish as a doctor. Asclepiades was a leading physician in Rome and a close friend of Cicero. [19]    He developed his own version of the molecular structure of the human body. Asclepiades' model of the atom had many-shaped atoms passing through body pores.[20] These atoms were round, square, triangular. Asclepiades argued that as long as the atoms were in constant and unceasing motion, human health would be maintained.[19] He believed that if the atoms were too large or the pores too narrow, the disease would manifest itself with many symptoms, such as fever, spasms, or, in more severe cases, paralysis.[19]    Asclepiad hot as a cure. and was a firm believer in cold baths, his technique deliberately not causing severe pain to the patient. Asclepiadles used methods that caused the least discomfort while continuing to treat the patient. [19] His other treatments included music therapy to induce relaxation and drinking wine to treat headaches and fevers. Asclepiades is the first documented physician to use massage therapy in Rome. [19]    Hospitals    Plan of valetudinarium near DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. End of the 1st century  The first hospitals were established in the Roman medical system; These were reserved for slaves and soldiers. Medics were assigned to escort troops or ships and attend to the wounded. In Rome, death was caused by poor sanitation, starvation, disease, epidemics, malnutrition, and warfare; this led to a high Roman death rate.[21] The development of health services was prolonged by the Romans' indifference to the sick, superstition and religious beliefs.[22]    Ancient Roman hospitals were valetu in the first century BC.established as military hospitals known as dinars.[23] The valetudinaria consisted of small tents and forts dedicated to wounded soldiers.[24] Actual hospitals were built along the main roads and soon became part of the Roman fortress architecture. They are usually located near the outer wall, in a quiet part of the fortification.[22] The oldest Roman hospitals of the Roman Empire were built in the 1st-2nd centuries AD,[25] during the reign of Emperor Trajan. The Roman military created these hospitals because the expansion of the army beyond the Italian peninsula meant that the wounded could not be treated in private homes.[25] Temporary forts eventually became permanent buildings.[26] Perhaps some valteduinaria were established in earlier parts of history. They may also have been installed by Julius Caesar.[27] Other hospitals were probably built under Augustus or Claudius.",
  "toj_mahal": "Taj Mahal",
  "toj_mahal_desc": "Taj Mahal (\"Crown of Palaces\") is a mausoleum-mosque located in Agra, India. It was built in memory of Mumtaz Mahal's wife, who died during the birth of her 14th child, by the order of Shah Jahan, the ruler of the Babur Empire. Later, Shah Jahan himself was buried here. Since 1983, Taj Mahal has been included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. Built in 1630-1653, the building was built by the hands of 20,000 craftsmen. Lahori is considered to be the main designer of the mausoleum, according to other sources Isa Muhammad Efandi. Construction and architecture of Taj Mahal  Inside the Taj Mahal, you can see 2 tombs - Shah Jahan and his wife Mumtaz Mahal. This 5-domed structure reaches a height of 74 meters, with one 41-meter minaret at each corner.    An interesting fact is that all the minarets are deliberately turned away from the mausoleum in order not to damage it in the event of a breach. The walls of the Taj Mahal are surrounded by transparent marble, which was made 600 km away from the construction site.    At the same time, you can see the walls decorated with dozens of pearls, including agate and malachite. It should be noted that marble changes color at different times of the day: pink at dawn, white during the day, and silvery in the moonlight.    A 15-kilometer ramp made of rolled earth was used to deliver marble and other building materials. In it, 30 bulls were dragged in a block at a time, assigned to a special cart. When the block was delivered to the construction site, it was raised to the required level using unique mechanisms.    It goes without saying that a lot of water was required to build such a large-scale structure. To ensure a complete water supply, the architects used river water, which was delivered to the construction site through a bucket-rope system. It took about 12 years to build the tomb and the platform. The rest of the Taj Mahal, including the minarets, the mosque, the jawab and the Great Gate, was built in exact sequence over another 10 years. Construction materials were delivered from various regions of Asia. More than 1000 elephants were involved for this. In total, 28 types of stones were used to cover the white marble imported from neighboring countries. In addition to tens of thousands of workers, 37 people were responsible for the artistic appearance of the Taj Mahal, each of whom was a master of his work. was. As a result, the builders were able to build an extremely beautiful and magnificent building.    The total area of the entire Taj Mahal complex was 600 x 300 meters, along with other buildings in a rectangular shape. The beautifully polished white marble walls of the bejeweled mausoleum reflect both the sunlight and the moonlight.    In front of the structure is a large marble pool, in whose waters you can see the reflection of the Taj Mahal. Inside the octagonal burial chamber are the mausoleums of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan. Islam forbids elaborate decoration of burial places. Therefore, the bodies of the spouses were placed in a relatively simple crypt under the inner chamber.    Many symbols are hidden in the design of the complex. For example, on the doors leading to the garden surrounding the mausoleum, verses from the 89th chapter of the Qur'an are engraved: \"O you, resting soul! Return to the presence and pleasure of your Lord! Enter with my servants. Enter my paradise! \\\"    To the west of the tomb, you can see the mosque, parallel to which is the guest house (jawab). The Taj Mahal complex is symmetrical about the axis, except for the tomb of Shah Jahan, which was built after his death.    The complex has fountains. there is a garden and a 300 mÂ² long pond.On the south side there is an enclosed courtyard with 4 gates, where the mausoleums of two more wives of the Padishah - Akbarabadi and Fatihpuri - were built.    Taj Mahal today  Recently cracks were found in the walls of the Taj Mahal . Experts immediately began to determine the reasons for their appearance. After careful research, scientists came to the conclusion that the cracks may have appeared as a result of the shallowing of the neighboring Jamna River.    The fact is that the disappearance of the Jamna caused the soil The Taj Mahal has started to lose its famous whiteness due to air pollution. In order to prevent this, the authorities have decided to expand the park and shut down all the polluting industries in Agra. gave an order about The use of coal has been banned here, preferring environmentally friendly gas to this type of fuel.    However, despite the measures taken, the mausoleum continues to look yellow. As a result, in order to make the walls of the Taj Mahal as white as possible, workers constantly clean them with bleaching clay.    Bto this day, tens of thousands of tourists (5-7 million per year) come to see the mausoleum every day, thanks to which the state budget of India is significantly replenished. Since driving vehicles with internal combustion engines is prohibited here, visitors have to walk or take an electric bus from the bus station to the Taj Mahal.    Interestingly, in 2019, in order to combat over-tourism, the complex has more than 3 hours. fines were introduced for guests. Now the mausoleum is one of the new 7 wonders of the world.    Before visiting the attraction, tourists can visit the official website of Taj Mahal. There you can find opening hours and ticketing information, what you can and can't do, and other equally important information.    Toj Mahal Photos\",",
  "usmoniylar": "Ottoman Empire",
  "usmoniylar_desc": "The Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman State (called the Ottoman Empire in Europe) is a state ruled by the Ottoman dynasty in Asia Minor, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, partly in the Caucasus and Crimea (1299-1922). The Ottoman Empire was founded by Osman I. This state was originally formed as a small fief (beylik) subordinate to the Konya Sultanate of the Seljuks in the northwestern part of Asia Minor in the Old City and Anatolia. Although the first ruler of this province was ErtoÄrul, the province became an independent state during the reign of his son Osmanbey, so it was named Ottoman province after him. Later, this country took the name of the Ottoman Empire and became one of the most powerful countries in the world in the Middle Ages. Osman I and his son Urkhan accepted the title of bey, while the rulers from the time of Urkhan's son Murad I were called sultans. During the period of Osman Ghazi, a number of military campaigns were made against the neighboring Byzantine Empire, the fortresses of Karacha Hisar and Yor Hisar, Bursa His son Urkhan Ghazi conquered the Byzantine cities of Bursa, Nicaea, Nicomedia, and reached the shores of the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara in the middle of the 14th century. During this period, the Ottoman Turks (which clan of the Oghuz Turks they belonged to) crossed the Dardanelles and entered the territory of Europe. In 1356, the conquest of the Balkans was completed, and a new province of Rumeli (Rumelia) was established on the territory of Europe. It was from this moment that the process of turning the Ottoman state into a kingdom began. In 1360, the Janissaries (Turkish: yangi cherik) - a special infantry force was established. The first capital of the state was Melangia, Bursa in 1326-1362. Sultan Murad I moved the capital from Bursa to Edirne (Adrianopole) in 1362. During his reign, new territories were conquered in Europe. After the defeat of the Serbs in the Battle of Kosovo (1389), Serbia was annexed to the Ottoman Empire. Sultan Bayezid I Yildirim captured the Bulgarian capital of Tirnovo (1393), defeated a united army of 60,000 crusader knights on the outskirts of Nikopol (1396), and began to besiege Constantinople, the capital of Byzantium. He included Bulgaria, Wallachia, Macedonia, Thessaly as part of his state. However, the defeat of the Ottoman Empire by the forces of Amir Temur at the Battle of Ankara in 1402 saved the Byzantine Empire from imminent destruction. During the reigns of Sultan Mahmud I and Murad II, the lost territories were recovered. Murad II Ghazi, who made a name for himself as a fair and honest ruler, attacked Constantinople in 1422. He defeated the Czech-Magyar army near Varna (November 10, 1444) and the Kosovo field (December 17-19, 1448) and made 2 campaigns against Albania in 1448-50.    Murod II's son. Mahmud II the Fatih personally commanded the Turkish troops and pursued a policy of pacifism. He captured Constantinople, the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire - Byzantium, after a 53-day siege (May 29, 1453), ending the Byzantine Empire. Constantinople was called the Turkish name of Istanbul, and the capital was moved here. After this victory, Mahmud II the Conqueror began to conquer the Balkans and Central European countries. Serbia (1459), Moravia (1460), Bosnia (1463), Wallachia (1476), Albania (1479) Trebizond - Trabzon (1461) were captured. The Crimean Khanate was transformed into a subordinate state (1475). Military operations against Uzun Hasan, the ruler of the White Sheep State, have been intensified. A plan to occupy the territories of European countries such as Italy, Germany, and Austria was drawn up and put into practice. During this period, major reforms were carried out in the field of military and administrative management, and measures were taken to strengthen the huge kingdom. Literature, art, and architecture flourished in particular.    In the reigns of Sultan Bayazid II, Salim I, and Suleiman I, the kingdom became extremely powerful. In particular, Salim I the Evil destroys the army of Ismail I, the king of the Safavids of Iran (August 23, 1514). Captures Iraq, Syria (Syria), Palestine, Egypt and enters Cairo (1517). At this time, in addition to Egypt, the Algerian region of North Africa, as well as the Balkans, Arabia, and South-Eastern Anatolia were part of the Ottoman Empire. During the Friday prayer in Aleppo (August 28, 1516), Sultan Salim I was given the honorary title of \"Servant of the Two Holy Cities\" and his name was added to the sermon as a caliph (Ottoman sultans from this date until 1924, at the same time as the Islamic world caliph is also considered). Sultan Suleiman I also continued the policy of globalization. After conquering Hungary, the Turks besieged Vienna 1 time (1529). Troops were sent to Poland and Ukraine, and Rhodes and other islands in the Aegean Sea were occupied. Solomon I King of France to fight against the legitimate \"Holy Roman Empire\".He signed the first French-Turkish political agreement and trade agreement with Francis I (1535). By 1556, the Ottoman Empire included Asia Minor, Western Georgia, Western Armenia, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq (including Baghdad), Palestine, Hejaz, Yemen, Egypt, Tripoli, Algeria, Greece, Bulgaria, Hungary, Serbia, Bosnia, Wallachia. , Transylvania, Moldavia, Crimea entered. At that time, it was considered one of the most powerful kingdoms in the world. The huge territory of the Sultanate occupies a large part of 3 continents: Europe, Asia, Africa, and its area is 8 million. reached kmÂ². In the 16th century, the powerful Turkish navy controlled the entire Mediterranean basin. During the reign of Sultan Murad III, the island of Cyprus was subdued. At that time, the territory from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Persian Gulf, from the Danube to the banks of the Nile belonged to the sultanate.    However, from the end of the 17th century, the military, political and economic power of the sultanate gradually began to weaken. European countries formed an alliance and began to fight against the Ottoman Empire. In 2 battles around Vienna, the Turkish army was defeated by the combined army of Austria, Germany and Poland (1683). Regular Russian-Turkey Wars (1676-1681, 1684-1699, 1768-1774, 1787-1791, 1828-1829, 1853-1856, 1853-1856, 1877-1878, 1914-1816, 1914-1816, 1914-1816, 1914-1816, 1914-1816, 1914-1878, 1914-1816, 1914-1816, 1914-1878, 1914-1816 ), the Ottoman Empire gradually weakened. Even at this time, the influence of the Wahhabis increased, and with the help of the British, they captured El-Khasa (1792), Karbala (1801), Mecca and Medina (1803-1806) in the Persian Gulf, and organized massacres against the Turks.    During the reigns of Salim III and Mahmud II. reforms were carried out to save the kingdom from disintegration. By carrying out further reforms (Tanzimat) (1839), Sultan AbdÃ¼lmajid was able, on the one hand, to stop the crisis of the sultanate, and on the other hand, to form a new Turkish intelligentsia (they called themselves the new Ottomans). In the Crimean War at this time, Turkey defeated its old rival, the Russian Empire, and regained its position on the Black Sea and the Danube. After the Tanzimat and the original constitution adopted in 1876 were abolished by Sultan Abdulhamid II (1878), the period of tyranny began in the country. During this period, the Sultanate became economically dependent on European countries. At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the members of the \"Union and Progress\" party made a determined effort to establish a constitutional monarchy in the country (Turkey). On November 1, 1922, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey decided to abolish the Sultanate. Mustafa Kemal (AtatÃ¼rk) led the national liberation movement against the invaders and founded the Republic of Turkey on October 29, 1923 in the territory of the sultanate, mainly inhabited by Turks - Asia Minor and partly in Europe. representatives of the two nations, first of all, scholars, scientists, poets, artists, established friendly relations during joint studies in madrasahs, pilgrimages, trade relations and mutual visits. In the relations between the two states, the diplomatic relations conducted by the heads of state occupy an important place. In order to jointly fight against the Safavid state, Sultan Salim I sent a letter to the Shaibani ruler Kochkunchikhan through the ambassador Muhammadbek (1514). In particular, Sultan Suleiman I the Righteous and Ubaydullah Khan of Bukhara worked together to fight against Iran. Sulayman I sent a large amount of weapons to Abdulatif Khan, the ruler of Shaibani in Samarkand (1551). Bukhara Khan Subhonqulikhan sent ambassadors to Sultan Suleiman II (1690) and developed friendly relations. In 1779, the emir of Bukhara, Danyolbi, appointed his son Ernazar Mas'ud as an ambassador to the Russian Empire, and then to the Ottoman Sultanate, trying to strengthen the relationship. In 1783-1784, Daniyolbi sent Muhammad Sharif as an ambassador to Sultan Abdulhamid I twice. The ambassador of the Turkish sultan, Mahmud Said Agha, will visit the Emir of Bukhara, Shahmurad. (1786) Sultan Salim III also sent his ambassadors in 1789. Emir of Bukhara Haydar Devanbegi Eshmuhammad and Mirza Muhammad Yusuf sent a letter to Istanbul asking Sultan Mahmud II for books on sharia (1815). Mahmud II sent a 32-volume book to Bukhara from his ambassador Hasan Chalabi. Khan of Khiva sent ambassadors to Istanbul and England after the Perovsky expedition against Ollokulikhan Khan and asked for military help. However, due to the distance, military aid was not sent to Khiva Khan, but Turkish cannon makers were sent. Khan of Kokand Sultan Syed Khan (1865) and Emir of Bukhara Muzaffar sent Mufti Khoja Muhammad Porso (1866) as an ambassador to Istanbul and asked for military assistance from the Sultanate.    Also between these countries, mcultural relations are widely established. Originally from Bursa, Qazizada was the director of Rumy Mirza Ulugbek's observatory, and he was the head teacher of the Ulugbek madrasa in Samarkand. After the death of Ulugbek, his student Ali Kushchi served in the palace of Sultan Mahmud II in Istanbul and became the head of the madrasa of St. Sophia. Jalaluddin Rumi's entire conscious activity took place in Konya (Asia Minor). The Naqshbandi and Yassawi sects of Sufism were also widespread in the territory of the Ottoman Empire, where the followers of Bahauddin Naqshband and Ahmad Yassawi, such as Yunus, Khoja Bektash Vali, Kiyikli Baba, grew up here. The linguist scientist, poet and ambassador Sulayman Bukhari lived in Istanbul in the middle of the 19th century and compiled the dictionary \"Dictionary of Chigatoy and Turkish Ottoman\" (2 volumes).    More than 100 students who went from Turkestan in the early 20th century (among them Fitrat, Usman Khoja, Otaulla Khojayev, Bekjon Rakhmanov and others) studied in Istanbul. The ideas of the Young Turks had a positive impact on the outlook of the Young Bukharans and Young Khiva people. The \"Bukhara Educational and Educational Society\" (1908) was established in Istanbul on the initiative of Dr. Nazim, head of the education department of the \"Union and Development\" party, and students from Turkestan. The community opened a separate school for Turkestan students in the new Jame' Mosque near the Victory Bridge in Istanbul and educated them for free. Many works of Fitrat were printed by the society for the first time in Istanbul.    16th - 18th centuries    Ottoman Empire, 1299-1683  Rise of the Empire    Ottoman Empire entered the period of rise during the reign of Mehmet II the Conqueror.  At the beginning of the 16th century, the whole empire Regions were divided into districts. Provinces were ruled by a wali, and sanjoks were ruled by a sanjokbey. The main support of the empire was its army. The army was formed by the armies of landowners. The Sultan distributed land and water in exchange for military service. Large landowners who were allocated in exchange for military service were called zaims and beys, and smaller landowners were called amulets and sipahis. They were obliged to arrive at the appointed place with a certain number of armed peasants, depending on the size of their land, as soon as the sultan issued an order during military operations. In addition, the empire had a standing army - janissaries, as well as a powerful navy. These factors allowed the Sultans of the Ottoman Turks to conduct wars of conquest on a large scale. As a result of such wars, the state of the Ottoman Turks became a huge empire. The empire continued wars of conquest in the 16th century. During this period, Iran became the biggest rival of the empire in Asia. In 1514, Sultan Salim I defeated the army of Ismail Safavi, the king of Iran. This victory opened the way for the sultan to start a campaign against the king's ally, the Egyptian sultanate. In 1516, he conquered Syria and Palestine along the way. In 1517, Cairo, the capital of Egypt, was captured. The empire gained colonies not only in Asia and Europe, but also in Africa.    The expansion of the territory of the empire led to the transfer of major trade routes to Turkey. These factors ensured the further strengthening of the central power and military power of the empire. As a result, Turkey's international influence and its role in the fate of European, Asian and African countries increased even more.

  "vizantiya": "Byzantine Empire",
  "vizantiya_desc": "The Byzantine Empire or the Eastern Roman Empire (Latin: Imperium Romanum; Greek: BasileÃ­a RhÅmaÃ­Ån) is a state that emerged in the economically developed eastern part of the Roman Empire after its collapse (IV-XV centuries). During its most prosperous period, it included a large part of the Balkan Peninsula, Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Cyrenaica, a part of Mesopotamia, Western Armenia and Georgia, Chersonesos, Cyprus and the islands of Crete.    The capital was the city of Constantinople. The name of the country is derived from the Greek polney on the coast of the Bosphorus - Byzantium. The population consisted of Greeks, Syriacs, Copts, Armenians, Georgians and others. The state language was Latin in the IV-VI centuries, and later Greek. At that time, Byzantium was far ahead of the countries of Western Europe in terms of the level of development of crafts and trade, as well as the vitality of city life. Trade with Arabia, the Black Sea, Iran, India, and China increased slightly. Due to its convenient geographical location, Byzantium became a political and military center, which led to the strengthening of cultural and economic relations between the East and the West. Administrative and legal reforms were carried out during the reign of Emperor Justinian I in 527-565. The central state was strengthened and a strong army was created. This allowed Justinian to conquer the Vandal state in North Africa in 533-534, the Ostrogoth kingdom in Italy in 555, and southeastern Spain. The last decade of the 6th century and the beginning of the 7th century saw internal decline and failures in foreign policy. A mutiny broke out in the army, and the masses of the people joined it. At the end of the 6th century and the beginning of the 7th century, the Slavs occupied a large part of Byzantium. In the 70s of the 7th century, the ancient Bulgarian state, Bulgaria, was established on the north-western border of Byzantium.    In 636-642, the Arabs seized Syria, Palestine, Upper Mesopotamia and Egypt from the West, and in 693-698, the lands in North Africa. The Lombards in Italy conquered much of Byzantine territory. In connection with the migration of Slavs to the Byzantine territory in the 8th-9th centuries, the free rural communities were strengthened under the influence of the dominant community relations in them. However, large land ownership increased in the 10th century, Byzantine cities rose again after the decline of the 7th-9th centuries, trade and craft associations were formed, and the state supported their activities. In the middle of the 10th century, Byzantium recovered Upper Mesopotamia, part of Asia Minor and Syria, Crete and Cyprus from the Arabs. Byzantium's influence increased in Armenia and Georgia. Byzantium conquered the Western Bulgarian kingdom (1018).    Talim  From the beginning of the 12th century, the internal disunity was on the rise, the central authority was in crisis, and the attacks of foreign invaders intensified. The participants of the Crusade conquered part of the territory of Byzantium and founded the Latin Empire. At the same time, independent Greek states appeared on the lands of Byzantium: Nicaea, Trebizond empires, Epirus state. In 1261, Emperor Michael VIII Paleologus of Nicaea restored the Byzantine Empire. The Paleolog dynasty (1261-1453) was established. However, Byzantium lost its height. could not recover his strength. In 1453, Constantinople came under the control of the Ottoman Turks. At the beginning of the 60s of the 15th century, the Byzantine Empire collapsed, its territory was included in the Ottoman Turkish Empire. Byzantium was a unique cultural center under the influence of Roman, Greek and Hellenistic traditions. Ancient educational traditions were preserved in Byzantium, and until the 12th century education was at a higher level than elsewhere in Europe. Primary education (teaching reading and writing) was carried out in private schools for 2-3 years. Until the 7th century, the curriculum was based on the legends of pagan religions, and later on the books of the Bible.    Secondary education was received under the guidance of a grammar teacher. The program includes orthography (spelling letters), grammar rules, pronunciation, rules of writing poetry, public speaking, and the methodology of document creation. Philosophy is also included in the curriculum. Some schools had a history lesson in their curriculum. Byzantium also had monastic schools. In the 4th-6th centuries, the higher schools left over from ancient times (in Africa, Alexandria, Beirut, Antioch, Gaza, Palestine Caesarea) continued their activities. The higher school (auditorium) established in Constantinople in 425 superseded other higher schools. The auditorium of Constantinople is a state institution, its professors are considered civil servants, only they are allowed to teach in the capital. By the middle of the 9th century, the Magnavr Higher School began to work.    This school trained high secular officials and religious leaders. In Constantinople in the middle of the 12th centuryriddic and philosophical schools were opened as public institutions. In the 12th century, medical science was also taught in the higher school. After 1204, the higher school was finished in Byzantium. Monastic schools increasingly supplanted state schools. Such schools were usually closed after the teacher's death or persecution. The ancient libraries of Byzantium did not go beyond the first period. The library of Alexandria was destroyed in 391. The Library of Constantinople (founded in 356) burned down in a fire in 475.    Agriculture  Although there is little information about later libraries, it is known that there were imperial, patriarchal, monastic libraries, universities, and private libraries. Technology Byzantium inherited the ancient agricultural technology (plough and hay rake, artificial irrigation system) and craftsmanship. This situation allowed Byzantium to remain an advanced country in Europe until the 12th century in agriculture, jewelry, silk weaving, construction of luxury buildings, shipbuilding (since the 9th century, inclined sails were used) and other fields; Since the 9th century, ceramic and glass making (according to ancient methods) has become an art.    Craftsmanship  However, the Byzantines' desire to preserve the traditions of their ancestors more or less hindered the development of technology. From the 12th century, it caused Byzantine crafts to lag behind Western European crafts (glassmaking, shipbuilding, etc.). By the 14th and 15th centuries, Byzantine textiles could not compete with Italian textiles. Mathematics and natural sciences. In Byzantium, the influence of literature among the public was very low compared to philosophy and rhetoric, which were considered the main subjects of the Middle Ages. Byzantine mathematicians of the 4th-6th centuries were mainly engaged in commenting on the works of ancient scholars: Theon (4th century) published and commented on the works of Euclid and Ptolemy, John Philoponus (6th century) commented on Aristotle's scientific works on natural science, and Eutochius Ascalon (6th century) on Archimedes. was engaged in commenting on such works.    Science  In some issues, Byzantine science advanced a little compared to the science of antiquity: John Philoponus came to the conclusion that the speed of falling objects does not depend on their weight; Anfili from Tral, an architect and engineer famous for building the Hagia Sophia, offered a new interpretation of the work of fire mirrors. By the 9th century, there was a slight rise in natural sciences. Inventor Lev Mathematician was the first to use letters as algebraic symbols. According to reports, there was an attempt to introduce Arabic numerals in the 12th century. Late Byzantine mathematicians were very interested in oriental science. Trebizond scholars (Grigory Chioniads, 12th century, his followers Gregory Chrysococcus and Isaac Argir, 14th century) studied Arabic and Persian mathematics and astronomy. The study of the legacy of Eastern science contributed to the creation of Theodore Melitinnota's \"Astronomy in Three Books\" (1361). In the field of cosmology, the Byzantines adhered to traditional ideas. Some of them believed in the worldviews presented in the Bible, while others believed that the doctrine of the sphericity of the Earth does not contradict the Bible. The science of astrology was severely criticized and persecuted by Orthodox theologians because it connected human destiny with the movement of heavenly bodies. In the 14th century, Nicephorus Grigoras proposed to reform the calendar (calendar), predicted solar eclipses. These proposals and predictions were directly related to astronomical observations.    The beginning of geography in Byzantium was based on official descriptions of fem (provinces), cities, episcopal administrative units. around 535, Hierocles compiled the synecdemus, which contains descriptions of 64 femmes and 912 cities. This collection became the basis for geographical works written in later periods. In the 10th century, Konstantin Bagryaiorodny compiled the description of Byzantine women based on the traditions of his time. Therefore, most of the information in his work is similar to the existing information of that time. Travel descriptions of merchants and pilgrims also belong to the category of geographical literature. In an unknown travelogue written in the 4th century, the Mediterranean Sea is described in detail, the distances between ports are indicated, goods produced in a certain place are mentioned, etc. Travel descriptions of the following have been preserved: \"Christian Topography\" by the merchant Cosmas Indikoplov (6th century) (which, in addition to general cosmological ideas, contains direct observational impressions, accurate information about various countries and peoples in Arabia, Africa and elsewhere), John Faulk (12th century) To Palestine, Andrei Livadin's (14th century) Palestine and Egypt, Kdescriptions of the travels of Anan Laskaris (late 14th or early 15th century) to Germany, Scandinavia and Iceland. Byzantines also knew how to make geographical maps.    Medicine  Medicine There was a developed medicine in Byzantium. In the 4th century, doctor Oribasi from Pergamon created a medical encyclopedia, doctor Nikshba wrote a textbook on surgery. Hospitals with special surgery and women's departments were established in Constantinople, and medical schools were opened in their presence. Simeon Siphus wrote a book on the properties of food (11th century). Nicholas Mireps compiled a pharmacopoeia manual (13th century). John Actuariy described his practical observations in his works on medicine. Philosophy began to appear due to the establishment of the empire and the spread of Christianity (from the 6th-7th centuries). Its development is influenced by the struggle between the views of representatives of official church beliefs and secular science and philosophical thought. Procopius (465-525), Byzantine Leontius (475-543), and John Damascene were predecessors of this philosophy. Byzantine philosophy mainly consisted in explaining and spreading the ideas and works of Plato and Aristotle; it began with Photius (820-891), the author of the \"Library\" collection (until 857), and reached its peak in the work of Michael Psellus (1018-78) and Nicephorus Vlemmidus (1272 AD). Then it developed again in Italy during the Renaissance. The services of V. Vissarion (1403-72), George of Trapezund (1396-1484) and others are great in this. The irrational trend in Byzantine philosophy was manifested in the mysticism of Simeon (1025-92) and the ideas of Nicholas Cavasila (14th century). Byzantine philosophy greatly influenced the development of medieval scholasticism, the Italian Renaissance, and the development of philosophical thought in Slavic countries, Georgia, and Armenia. In Byzantium, the science of history was somewhat developed. Eusebius of Caesarea. a thousand years ago. World history up to 324, including Shim. He tried to describe the history of the Black Sea coast. Procopius of Caesarea and Agafius covered the history of Byzantium under the Emperor Justinian. In the 6th - 10th centuries, world history chronicles became the main historical genres of historians such as John Malala, Feofan Ispovednik, Feofilakt Simokatta, Georgy Amartol. In the middle of the 11th and 12th centuries, Byzantine historians (Leo Deacon, Nikita Khoniat, etc.) tried to write down the events they witnessed. From the 13th century, the Byzantine science of history faced a crisis. Jurisprudence. Traditionalism and consistency characteristic of Byzantine culture are especially evident in Byzantine jurisprudence. The foundation of Byzantine jurisprudence was laid with the systematic regulation of Roman law and the creation of civil law complexes. The most important of them is the Corpus juris civilis (6th century) - Byzantine jurisprudence relied on this collection, and the task of jurists was mainly to interpret and re-narrate this collection. In the 6th and 7th centuries, Corpus juris civilis was partially translated from Latin into Greek. These translations form the basis of Vasiliki's compilation, which was copied over and over again, often with marginal notes. In the form of an appendix to the Vasilikis, a variety of references - manuals, including \"synopsis\", were compiled, in which articles are arranged in alphabetical order on certain legal issues. In Byzantine jurisprudence, in addition to Roman law, the law of church fatwas based on the decisions (rules) of church cathedrals was also studied. After the establishment of a higher school of law in Constantinople, in the 11th century, the experience of the court of Constantinople was summarized in a collection of court decisions - \"Pyr\" (\"Experience\"). In the 12th century, Byzantine jurists (Zonara, Aristin, Valsamon) published several books interpreting the canons of church councils, in which they tried to harmonize the law of church fatwas with Roman law. In Byzantium, a notary was established, and in the 13th and 14th centuries, the courts of some femes created local service books for documents.    Literature  Byzantine literature is distinguished by its originality, new forms and richness of genres. Its history is divided into 3 main periods. In the first period (4th-6th centuries) he continued the traditions of ancient literature, at the same time he was influenced by the ideology of the Christian religion (poets Nonna, 4th-5th centuries, Agafius, Pavel Silensiari, 6th century). The creation of the story of the saints (hagiography) was in full swing. In the second period (7th-9th centuries), religious literature began to dominate under the influence of the church (Andrei of Crete, John Damaskin, Feodor the Studite). Among the poets, Cassia, John the Grammatician, Ignatius, Patriarch Photius wrote secular works. Folk art developed. In the last, third period (10-15 centuries), various genres of religious, secular, artistic and scientific literature developed. Emperor Constantine VII Bagrianorodny, Svida, Simeon Metafrasius and others are the most famous writers of this period. MiKhail Asell, Christopher of Mytilene (11th century), Manuel Olobol, Manuel Phil (13th-14th centuries) are representatives of court literature. Comedy became popular during this period (12th century).    Architecture  The developed period of Byzantine architecture corresponds to the 6th century. During this period, Constantinople was considered one of the largest cities in the world. The outskirts of the city were surrounded by strong fortress walls and ditches were dug (1st half of the 5th century). In the center of the city (Augustion Square), under the influence of Roman architecture, triumphal arches (arches), forums, church buildings, the imperial palace, stables, and aqueducts were built. \"Plinfa\" (flat wide brick) was widely used in the Byzantine school of architecture. The basilica style was used in the construction of the synagogue. Later, this style influenced the architecture of the neighboring countries. The Hagia Sophia in Constantinople (532-537) is a magnificent structure with a dome diameter of 31.4 m, a height of 55 m. .    In the construction of the Byzantine temple in the 7th-9th centuries, the classical type of structures with a cruciform dome was used based on the Renaissance traditions characteristic of the style of medieval Italian architecture (Church of the Assumption in Nicaea, 7th century; Church of Hagia Sophia in Thessaloniki, 8th century). In the 9th-13th centuries, the shield-shaped arches on the base of the buildings were made of stone fragments and bricks and decorated with waves, covered with tiles in the form of curved steps, and colorful paintings were made [Mireleyon Temple (Budrum Jome in Turkish, 930), Feodor's Church (Kilise Jome in Turkish, 2nd of the 11th century) -half), Pantokrator temple complex (Zeyrek jome, 12th century) and 6.J. The influence of Balkan Slavic architecture is visible in the architectural decorations of the 14th-15th centuries [the five-domed Apostolic Church in Thessaloniki (Souksu jome in Turkish, 12th-15th centuries); The basement consisted of a central large vaulted room with a P-shaped gallery and small vaulted rooms located in the 4 corners]. The interior decoration of the buildings with the lower floor in the form of a basilica, and the upper floor with a cross-shaped dome (Tekfur Palace in Constantinople, 14th century; Mistra Rulers' Palace, 13th-15th centuries) shows Mistra sh. landscapes and monastic complexes (Athos, etc.) are depicted.    Fine art. Qad. the transition from the era to the Middle Ages created deep crises in artistic culture; some types of fine arts appeared, existing ones disappeared. The types of art related to the needs of the church and the state (church images, icons and book miniatures) became important. The ancient creative style was replaced by features characteristic of the Middle Ages (including conditionality); sculpture is in crisis, c. elegant forms were destroyed, after a certain period, sculpture in Byzantine art completely disappeared, remaining only in relief images. Artifacts (stone, bone, metal), church tiles of the 4th-5th centuries (St. George's Church, the end of the 4th century). the tones are important, and the beauty of being is felt as before. Qad. the methods were repeated in the art of V. in book miniatures (\"Jesus Scrolls\"); all types of color images were subordinated to the processing of images on religious themes, architectural scenes were replaced by an abstract luxurious golden background, images were processed on a flat surface.    In the 9th - 10th centuries, temple wall paintings were brought into a permanent system; the walls and domes were covered with tile decorations and frescoes in a strict order, an architectural artistic environment (including icons) subordinated to a single content was created in the interior decoration: the mosaics of the Hagia Sophia temple (6th-12th centuries), the Daphne monastery near Athens (11th century), The icon of \"Vladimir Eve\" and other    Book miniatures developed, during this period jewelry decoration was used effectively, vivid scenes of life, portraits of historical figures were reflected in the paintings. Sculpture The interior decoration of the Galla Placidia mausoleum is notable for its iconography and carved decorations (capitals, altarpieces, etc.). Applied decorative arts (fabrics, colorful enamel panels, ivory and metalwork) were highly developed. The traditions of V.'s visual art of this period were taken from the Greek medieval art and Central, Eastern and Jan. It had a strong influence on the formation of several national art schools in European countries.    Theatr  Byzantine secular theater was the successor of the ancient theater. In the 4th century, there were 4 theaters in Constantinople, where mime and pantomime (wordless, gestural) dramas and topical plays were performed. The church took the show to ChristianityKhail Asell, Christopher of Mytilene (11th century), Manuel Olobol, Manuel Phil (13th-14th centuries) are representatives of court literature. Comedy became popular during this period (12th century).    Architecture  The developed period of Byzantine architecture corresponds to the 6th century.

Despite the restoration of Constantinople and the Empire by the Paleologian emperors in 1261, the Empire could not regain its former power. Nevertheless, these periods were the periods when the culture of the empire was at its peak.[7] Incessant civil wars in the 14th century weakened the empire, and its remaining territories were conquered by the Ottoman Empire during the Byzantine-Ottoman Wars, which lasted until the fall of Constantinople in 1453.\",",

  "xamurappi_desc": "The Byzantine Empire or the Eastern Roman Empire (Latin: Imperium Romanum; Greek: BasileÃ­a RhÅmaÃ­Ån) is a state that emerged in the economically developed eastern part of the Roman Empire after its collapse (IV-XV centuries). During its most prosperous period, it included a large part of the Balkan Peninsula, Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Cyrenaica, a part of Mesopotamia, Western Armenia and Georgia, Chersonesos, Cyprus and the islands of Crete.    The capital was the city of Constantinople. The name of the country is derived from the Greek polney on the coast of the Bosphorus - Byzantium. The population consisted of Greeks, Syriacs, Copts, Armenians, Georgians and others. The state language was Latin in the IV-VI centuries, and later Greek. At that time, Byzantium was far ahead of the countries of Western Europe in terms of the level of development of crafts and trade, as well as the vitality of city life. Trade with Arabia, the Black Sea, Iran, India, and China increased slightly. Due to its convenient geographical location, Byzantium became a political and military center, which led to the strengthening of cultural and economic relations between the East and the West. Administrative and legal reforms were carried out during the reign of Emperor Justinian I in 527-565. The central state was strengthened and a strong army was created. This allowed Justinian to conquer the Vandal state in North Africa in 533-534, the Ostrogoth kingdom in Italy in 555, and southeastern Spain. The last decade of the 6th century and the beginning of the 7th century saw internal decline and failures in foreign policy. A mutiny broke out in the army, and the masses of the people joined it. At the end of the 6th century and the beginning of the 7th century, the Slavs occupied a large part of Byzantium. In the 70s of the 7th century, the ancient Bulgarian state, Bulgaria, was established on the north-western border of Byzantium.    In 636-642, the Arabs seized Syria, Palestine, Upper Mesopotamia and Egypt from the West, and in 693-698, the lands in North Africa. The Lombards in Italy conquered much of Byzantine territory. In connection with the migration of Slavs to the Byzantine territory in the 8th-9th centuries, the free rural communities were strengthened under the influence of the dominant community relations in them. However, large land ownership increased in the 10th century, Byzantine cities rose again after the decline of the 7th-9th centuries, trade and craft associations were formed, and the state supported their activities. In the middle of the 10th century, Byzantium recovered Upper Mesopotamia, part of Asia Minor and Syria, Crete and Cyprus from the Arabs. Byzantium's influence increased in Armenia and Georgia. Byzantium conquered the Western Bulgarian kingdom (1018).    Talim  From the beginning of the 12th century, the internal disunity was on the rise, the central authority was in crisis, and the attacks of foreign invaders intensified. The participants of the Crusade conquered part of the territory of Byzantium and founded the Latin Empire. At the same time, independent Greek states appeared on the lands of Byzantium: Nicaea, Trebizond empires, Epirus state. In 1261, Emperor Michael VIII Paleologus of Nicaea restored the Byzantine Empire. The Paleolog dynasty (1261-1453) was established. However, Byzantium lost its height. could not recover his strength. In 1453, Constantinople came under the control of the Ottoman Turks. At the beginning of the 60s of the 15th century, the Byzantine Empire collapsed, its territory was included in the Ottoman Turkish Empire. Byzantium was a unique cultural center under the influence of Roman, Greek and Hellenistic traditions. Ancient educational traditions were preserved in Byzantium, and until the 12th century education was at a higher level than elsewhere in Europe. Primary education (teaching reading and writing) was carried out in private schools for 2-3 years. Until the 7th century, the curriculum was based on the legends of pagan religions, and later on the books of the Bible.    Secondary education was received under the guidance of a grammar teacher. The program includes orthography (spelling letters), grammar rules, pronunciation, rules of writing poetry, public speaking, and the methodology of document creation. Philosophy is also included in the curriculum. Some schools had a history lesson in their curriculum. Byzantium also had monastic schools. In the 4th-6th centuries, the higher schools left over from ancient times (in Africa, Alexandria, Beirut, Antioch, Gaza, Palestine Caesarea) continued their activities. The higher school (auditorium) established in Constantinople in 425 superseded other higher schools. The auditorium of Constantinople is a state institution, its professors are considered civil servants, only they are allowed to teach in the capital. By the middle of the 9th century, the Magnavr Higher School began to work.    This school trained high secular officials and religious leaders. In Constantinople in the middle of the 12th centuryriddic and philosophical schools were opened as public institutions. In the 12th century, medical science was also taught in the higher school.

MiKhail Asell, Christopher of Mytilene (11th century), Manuel Olobol, Manuel Phil (13th-14th centuries) are representatives of court literature. Comedy became popular during this period (12th century).    Architecture  The developed period of Byzantine architecture corresponds to the 6th century. During this period, Constantinople was considered one of the largest cities in the world. The outskirts of the city were surrounded by strong fortress walls and ditches were dug (1st half of the 5th century). In the center of the city (Augustion Square), under the influence of Roman architecture, triumphal arches (arches), forums, church buildings, the imperial palace, stables, and aqueducts were built. \"Plinfa\" (flat wide brick) was widely used in the Byzantine school of architecture. The basilica style was used in the construction of the synagogue. Later, this style influenced the architecture of the neighboring countries. The Hagia Sophia in Constantinople (532-537) is a magnificent structure with a dome diameter of 31.4 m, a height of 55 m. .    In the construction of the Byzantine temple in the 7th-9th centuries, the classical type of structures with a cruciform dome was used based on the Renaissance traditions characteristic of the style of medieval Italian architecture (Church of the Assumption in Nicaea, 7th century; Church of Hagia Sophia in Thessaloniki, 8th century). In the 9th-13th centuries, the shield-shaped arches on the base of the buildings were made of stone fragments and bricks and decorated with waves, covered with tiles in the form of curved steps, and colorful paintings were made [Mireleyon Temple (Budrum Jome in Turkish, 930), Feodor's Church (Kilise Jome in Turkish, 2nd of the 11th century) -half), Pantokrator temple complex (Zeyrek jome, 12th century) and 6.J. The influence of Balkan Slavic architecture is visible in the architectural decorations of the 14th-15th centuries [the five-domed Apostolic Church in Thessaloniki (Souksu jome in Turkish, 12th-15th centuries); The basement consisted of a central large vaulted room with a P-shaped gallery and small vaulted rooms located in the 4 corners]. The interior decoration of the buildings with the lower floor in the form of a basilica, and the upper floor with a cross-shaped dome (Tekfur Palace in Constantinople, 14th century; Mistra Rulers' Palace, 13th-15th centuries) shows Mistra sh. landscapes and monastic complexes (Athos, etc.) are depicted.    Fine art. Qad. the transition from the era to the Middle Ages created deep crises in artistic culture; some types of fine arts appeared, existing ones disappeared. The types of art related to the needs of the church and the state (church images, icons and book miniatures) became important. The ancient creative style was replaced by features characteristic of the Middle Ages (including conditionality); sculpture is in crisis, c. elegant forms were destroyed, after a certain period, sculpture in Byzantine art completely disappeared, remaining only in relief images. Artifacts (stone, bone, metal), church tiles of the 4th-5th centuries (St. George's Church, the end of the 4th century). the tones are important, and the beauty of being is felt as before. Qad. the methods were repeated in the art of V. in book miniatures (\"Jesus Scrolls\"); all types of color images were subordinated to the processing of images on religious themes, architectural scenes were replaced by an abstract luxurious golden background, images were processed on a flat surface.    In the 9th - 10th centuries, temple wall paintings were brought into a permanent system; the walls and domes were covered with tile decorations and frescoes in a strict order, an architectural artistic environment (including icons) subordinated to a single content was created in the interior decoration: the mosaics of the Hagia Sophia temple (6th-12th centuries), the Daphne monastery near Athens (11th century), The icon of \"Vladimir Eve\" and other    Book miniatures developed, during this period jewelry decoration was used effectively, vivid scenes of life, portraits of historical figures were reflected in the paintings. Sculpture The interior decoration of the Galla Placidia mausoleum is notable for its iconography and carved decorations (capitals, altarpieces, etc.). Applied decorative arts (fabrics, colorful enamel panels, ivory and metalwork) were highly developed. The traditions of V.'s visual art of this period were taken from the Greek medieval art and Central, Eastern and Jan. It had a strong influence on the formation of several national art schools in European countries.    Theatr  Byzantine secular theater was the successor of the ancient theater. In the 4th century, there were 4 theaters in Constantinople, where mime and pantomime (wordless, gestural) dramas and topical plays were performed. The church took the show to Christianityconsidering it an element of paganism, he lost the traditions of the ancient theater in V. and expelled the actors from the Christian communities. Theater buildings were demolished, manuscripts of drama works were destroyed. The Church treated mimes with particular cruelty, but their traditions continued among the masses. For the purpose of religious propaganda, the Byzantine Church promoted dramas in the spirit of the Bible and liturgical images.    Music  Byzantine worldly professional music consisted of court celebration - the reciting of congratulatory words in prayers (acclamation), and the singing of poetic passages in quiet tones accompanied by instruments (euphemism). and singing polychromy hymns at ceremonial events is common. Among the sounds, hydravlos (water organ), trumpet, cymbal, and later pneumatic organ became famous. In religious music, unison, unaccompanied, unique melodious reading of biblical texts (psalmody), badiha (tropars) close to folk tunes, and philosophical lyrical songs (hymns) with developed melody took the main place. Poet and musician Roman Khushkhan, who lived in the 5th and 6th centuries, created highly developed works (kondaks). John Damascene (7th-8th centuries) is the most famous author of religious hymns. Byzantine music, which was the leader in Europe until the 9th century, later fell into a crisis. One of the artists of the last period, John Kukuzel (14th-15th centuries) was famous as a music theorist and the author of hymns.    Byzantine culture, science, art, education and literature, Asia, Shim. Africa has greatly influenced the cultural development of many countries in Europe. For this reason, the cultural heritage of Byzantium is still being studied by scholars (see Byzantium studies).    Byzantium, Byzantium, Eastern Roman Empire (395-1453) is a state that emerged from the division of the Roman Empire into western and eastern parts after the death of Theodosius I in 395. Eighty years after the split, the Western Roman Empire disappeared, leaving Byzantium as the historical, cultural, and civilizational successor to Ancient Rome. gives birth. However, there are a few important dates. In 285, Emperor Diocletian divided the administration of the Roman Empire into western and eastern parts.[3] Between 324 and 330, Emperor Constantine I moved the main capital from Rome to Constantinople. The city became \"Constantinople\" (\"City of Constantine\") or \"Nova Roma\" (\"New Rome\").{{#tag:ref|The first instance of the designation \\\"New Rome\\\" in an official document is found in the canons of the First Council of Constantinople (381), where it is used to justify the claim that the patriarchal seat of Constantinople is second only to that of Rome.[4] During the reign of Emperor Theodosius I, Christianity became the state religion of the empire. The final period of division began when Emperor Heraclius introduced new military and administrative structures in the new empire, replacing Latin with Greek as the official language.[5] The reason for these changes was that many of the non-Greek speaking areas of the Middle East and North Africa were being conquered by the growing Arab Caliphate, leaving the empire with only Greek territories. Thus, Byzantium differs from ancient Rome in that it changed to Greek culture instead of Latin culture, and from Roman paganism to Orthodoxy. reached its peak in its history. During the Justinian Plague in the mid-6th century, a third of the empire's population was wiped out, causing military and financial problems. Nevertheless, under Emperor Maurice, the eastern borders of the empire were expanded and the western borders were stabilized. Maurice's assassination in 602 led to a twenty-year war with Sassanid Iran, which depleted the empire's manpower and resources despite the victories of Emperor Heraclius. The weakening of the empire in this war led to defeats in the Byzantine-Arab wars of the 7th century. In these defeats, the empire lost large territories. Despite these setbacks, the empire recovered during the 10th century under the leadership of the Macedonian dynasty and became the most powerful country in Europe and the Mediterranean. After 1071, a large part of Asia Minor, which was considered the heart of the empire, was occupied by the Seljuk Turks.     The Komnenian restoration in the 12th century returned the lands and power to the empire. But after the death of Emperor Manuel I Comnenus and the end of the Comnenian dynasty at the end of the 12th century, the empire sank again. The Empire-Destroying Blow came in 1204 when Constantinople was captured and destroyed during the Fourth Crusade.and Byzantium were given to each other when they were divided into competing Greek and Latin states. Despite the restoration of Constantinople and the Empire by the Paleologian emperors in 1261, the Empire could not regain its former power. Nevertheless, these periods were the periods when the culture of the empire was at its peak.[7] Incessant civil wars in the 14th century weakened the empire, and its remaining territories were conquered by the Ottoman Empire during the Byzantine-Ottoman Wars, which lasted until the fall of Constantinople in 1453.",

  "xristofor_desc": "A person who left a big mark in the history of geographical discoveries. Among the famous tourists, there are few who are equal to Christopher Columbus in terms of the number of works covering different aspects of his life. Because the life of the tourist, who was born in the city of Genoa in northern Italy in 1451, is still attracting the attention of researchers in various fields with its wealth of mysteries. He spent three-quarters of his life on sea voyages. In particular, he was first recruited to the Genoese fleet in 1465, and served in the Portuguese fleet from 1470 to 1485. He was mainly employed on merchant ships, making maps and improving his knowledge of natural sciences. There is no specific information about it. But according to the tourist, this project of his was based on the information left by ancient scientists about the shape of the Earth as a sphere, and the inaccurate calculations of the dimensions of the Earth by scientists living in Europe in the 15th century.    There is no way to get to India by sea. X. Columbus, who received a refusal from the king of Portugal to his request to implement the project of finding the sea, moved to the Spanish province of Castile in 1485. In the same place, with the help of Andalusian merchants and bankers, he managed to organize his first sea expedition.    The first expedition of X. Columbus during the years 1492-1493 with a crew of 90 people - \"Santa Maria\", \"Pinta\" \" and \"Ninya\" ships. In August 1492, the expedition sailed west from the Canary Islands and crossed the Atlantic Ocean. X. Columbus discovered the Sargasso Sea along the way, reached the Bahamian archipelago on October 12, 1492 and named it San Salvador. This date is now officially recognized as the day America was discovered.    In October 1492, the brave traveler sailed to several other Bahamas islands, and in early December of the same year, he discovered the coast of Cuba and reached the island of Haiti. In March 1493, he safely returned to Spain on the \"NiÃ±a\" ship. The results of his first expedition caused great political uproar in Europe. X. Columbus's second expedition was organized in 1493-1496, in which 17 ships with a crew of more than 2.5 thousand participated. With the title of admiral and viceroy of the newly discovered lands, the traveler discovered Dominica, Guadeloupe and more than 20 Antilles in November 1493, reaching Puerto Rico. In the spring of 1494, Columbus explored the interior of the island of Haiti in search of gold, and in the summer of the same year he discovered the southern coast of Cuba, the islands of Juventud and Jamaica. In the summer of 1496, Columbus returned to Spain with a wealth of information about the newly discovered islands. started by himself. At the end of July 1498, the expedition passed by the island of Trinidad, entered the Gulf of Paria and discovered the confluence of the Orinoco River and the Paria Peninsula. After discovering other islands near the coast of South America, they returned to the island of Haiti. In 1500, H. Columbus was accused of not being able to find a way to India, was arrested and sent to Spain. But the Spanish government, taking into account the gold wealth of the discovered lands, later released him. made his fourth expedition. In the summer of 1502, he discovered the island of Martinique and the Gulf of Honduras. It was here that he first encountered representatives of the ancient Mayan civilization. From August 1502 to May 1503, he explored more than 2,000 km of the coast of the Caribbean Sea in Central America. After not finding a way to the west, the tourist swam to the north. But in June 1503, he was wrecked near the island of Jamaica. Help arrived only after a year, and X. Columbus returned to Spain in November 1504 in a serious condition. That is why he called the natives of the lands he discovered Hindus. Of course, you are aware of the use of the expression \"Hindu\" even today.    Although X. Columbus is recognized as a tourist who discovered America, he is not considered the first European to visit North America. Becausea few hundred years ago, the Vikings who lived in Greenland reached the northern shores of this continent. But it should be noted that only X. Columbus's journey made a world-wide turning point in world history.    According to his contemporaries, X. Columbus was a middle-aged, strong, intelligent person with the ability to convince his interlocutors of his opinion. . As a symbol of respect for the tourist's legacy in the history of geographical discoveries, many natural and social objects in the world are named after him. For example, a country in South America, a province in Canada, a federal district and a river in the USA, the capital of Sri Lanka, as well as many rivers, mountain ranges, lakes, waterfalls, cities, parks and bridges in different countries are named after him. . There are statues in many cities in North and South America. Also, statues of the great sailor-tourist were installed in one of the central avenues of Barcelona, Spain, and in Bremerhaven, Germany.",
  "yer": "Planet Earth",
  "yer_desc": "Earth is the third planet (after Mercury and Venus) in the solar system. It revolves around the Sun on its axis and in an elliptical orbit that is very close to circular. In terms of size and mass, Earth is the fifth largest planet (after Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). The presence of life on Earth is different from other planets in the Solar System. However, since life is a natural stage in the evolution of matter, Earth is the only one in the universe where life exists. a cosmic body, and forms of life on Earth cannot be considered the only forms of existence. Astronomical symbol - \\uD83D\\uDF28.    According to modern theories of cosmogony, the Earth appeared 4.7 billion years ago by gravitational condensation (combination) of gaseous chemical elements in the space around the Sun. During the formation of the Earth, due to the heat released as a result of the decay of radioactive elements, the interior of the Earth gradually warmed up, which led to the differentiation of the Earth's substance, resulting in the formation of different concentric layers of the Earth - geospheres, which differ from each other in terms of chemical composition, aggregate state and physical properties. was It was determined based on the study of the structure of the Earth's interior, the distribution of seismic waves on the surface of the Earth and its entire volume. These waves are longitudinal and transverse waves, and their propagation in the solid and liquid layers that make up the Earth's interior takes on different forms. Based on these modern methods, the study of the inner layers of the Earth gave the following results. Below it is a liquid outer core to a depth of 5,500 km, and in the center lies a solid subcore with a diameter of about 1,500 km. Outside the Earth, there are outer geospheres - water sphere (hydrosphere) and air sphere (atmosphere). Most of the Earth's surface is occupied by the oceans (361.1 million km2 or 70.8%), the land area is 149.1 million km2 (29.2%) (the land consists of six large continents and many islands). The continent of Eurasia is divided into two continents: Europe and Oceania, and the continents of North and South America are considered one continent, sometimes the islands of the Pacific Ocean are called Oceania, and its area is usually combined with Australia. divided into oceans, some researchers separate parts of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans near Antarctica as the Southern Ocean.    The Northern Hemisphere of the Earth mainly consists of continents (39% land), the Southern Hemisphere - oceans (only 19% land) . Most of the Western Hemisphere is water, and most of the Eastern Hemisphere is land.    The difference between the highest point and the lowest point of the Earth reaches about 20 km, the highest peak in the world is Jomolungma (Everest) (in the Hi-Molai Mountains) at 8848 m. and the deepest Mariana Trench (in the Pacific Ocean) is 11,022 m.    Earth has gravitational, thermal, magnetic and electric fields. The Earth's gravitational force keeps the Moon and satellites in orbit around the Earth. The spherical (round) shape of the Earth, many features of the surface relief, the flow of rivers, the movement of glaciers, etc. processes are also consequences of the gravitational field.    The magnetic field arises from various processes in the Earth's core and mantle (see Earth's magnetism). The Earth's electric field is also closely related to its magnetic field (see Atmospheric Electricity). In the atmosphere and magnetosphere, the primary cosmic factors undergo a great change. Cosmic rays, solar wind, X-ray, ultraviolet, optical and radio rays of the sun are absorbed, etc. undergoes changes, which is important for processes on the Earth's surface. The magnetosphere, in particular, the atmosphere, traps most of the electromagnetic and corpuscular radiation, protecting living organisms from its destructive effects.    The Earth receives 1.7-1017 J/s of solar radiation, but only 50% of it reaches the Earth's surface, and the Earth serves as the source of energy for many processes on the surface.    The Earth's surface, hydrosphere, as well as the atmosphere and the near-surface layers of the Earth's crust are collectively called the geographic crust or the landscape crust. Life originated in the geographic crust. Living matter is also a geological force that has fundamentally changed the geographical crust. The area of the Earth where life and bio-genetic products are distributed is called the biosphere.    A discussion about the Earth, its shape, structure and place in the Universe. knowledge was formed in the process of long-term research. In ancient times (7th century BC, Thales) the Earth was considered a flat body surrounded by water, and laterq (6th century BC, Anaximander) in cylindrical shape and, finally, av. In the 2nd half of the 6th century (Pythagoras) imagined that it is in the shape of a sphere. Mil. av. In the 4th century, Aristotle was the first to prove that the Earth is spherical by studying the phenomenon of the Moon entering the Earth's shadow (lunar eclipse). The diameter of the earth in miles. av. In the 3rd century, Eratosthenes of Alexandria measured to a fairly high degree of accuracy. In the 9th century, Khorezmi and Ahmad al-Farghani achieved a more accurate measurement of the Earth's diameter based on the measurement of the arc of the Earth's meridian. Abu Rayhan Beruni is the scientist who measured the length of the Earth's radius and the length G using a simple method of decreasing the angle of inclination.    For many years, the Earth was considered the center of the Universe. Only by the 16th century, Polish astronomer N. Copernicus proved that the Earth is one of the ordinary planets revolving around the Sun based on the explanation of the surface-like movements of the planets against the stars. In 1687, after the proof of the universal gravitation cone by I. Newton, the theory of the heliocentric system was finally decided. The structure of the \"solid\" Earth was determined mainly by the achievements of seismology in the 20th century.    When the phenomenon of radioactive decay of elements was discovered, many fundamental concepts had to be revised. For example, instead of the idea that the Earth was first liquid fire, the theory appeared that the Earth was formed from solid cold particles (see Schmidt's hypothesis). Radioactive methods of determining the absolute age of rocks have been developed. This made it possible to determine how long the Earth's history lasted, and the speed of processes on the Earth's surface. kg, which is equal to 1/330000 of the mass of the Sun. Under the influence of the Sun's gravity, the Earth, like the other planets in the Solar System, revolves around the Sun in an elliptical orbit, which is very little different from a circle. The Sun is at one of the foci of the Earth's elliptical orbit. Therefore, the distance between the Earth and the Sun changes from 147.117 million km (perihelion) to 152.083 million km (aphelion) during the year. The semi-major axis of the Earth's orbit, equal to 149.6 million km, is considered a unit for measuring distances within the Solar System (see Astronomical unit). The average speed of the Earth's orbit is 29,765 km/s, varying from 30.27 km/s (at perihelion) to 29.27 km/s (at aphelion). Along with the Sun, the Earth also rotates around the center of the Galaxy, the galactic rotation period is about 200 million years, the average speed of movement is 250 km/s. Relative to the nearest stars, the Sun moves with the Earth towards the Hercules constellation at a speed of ~ 19.5 km/s. depending on the year it is called differently. The time it takes for the sun's center to pass through the vernal equinox twice is called a tropical year. A tropical year is the basis for solar calendars and is equal to 365.2422 mean solar days (see Calendar).    The position of the ecliptic plane and the shape of Earth's orbit change slowly over millions of years due to the influence of other planets. In this case, the deviation of the ecliptic from the Laplace plane varies from 0Â° to 2.9Â°, and the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit varies from 0 to 0.067. Now. eccentricity is equal to 0.0167 and decreases from 4-10~7 per year. If you look at the Earth from the North Pole of the Universe, it would be possible to see that the Earth rotates in a counter-clockwise direction in its orbit. The Earth has a complex shape under the influence of gravity, the centrifugal force caused by the rotation of the Earth around its axis, as well as internal and external forces that create relief. The surface of the gravitational potential (that is, the surface that is perpendicular (vertical) to the meridian at all points and coincides with the ocean level) is assumed to be approximately the shape of the Earth (in this case, changes in the water level due to the influence of waves, upwelling, currents and atmospheric pressure in the oceans are not taken into account). This is called a geoid shape. The volume limited to this surface is considered the volume of the Earth (the volume of the parts of the continents above sea level is not included). Geodesy, cartography, etc. In order to solve a number of scientific and practical issues, the ellipsoid surface of the Earth's shape is considered as the Earth's shape. Knowing the parameters of the Earth's ellipsoid, its position on the Earth, as well as the Earth's gravitational field is of great importance in astrodynamics, which studies the laws of motion of artificial space bodies (see Geodesy, Gravimetry).    Earth sphere shaIf considered as cli, each point on the equator moves with a speed of 462 m/s, and points at latitude sr with a speed of 463 cos f (m/s). The latitude dependence of the linear speed of rotation, and consequently of the centrifugal force, leads to different accelerations of gravity at different latitudes.    The axis of rotation of the Earth deviates from the perpendicular to the ecliptic plane by 23Â°26.5' (in 20th century terms); now this angle is decreasing by 0.47\" per year. When the Earth moves in an orbit around the Sun, the axis of rotation is almost constant in space. This creates the seasons. As a result of the rotation of the Earth on its axis, day and night are formed. The Earth's own The period of one revolution around its axis is called a day. Due to the gravitational influence of the Moon, Sun, etc., the Earth's axis inclination and eccentricity of the Earth's orbit are long-lasting, periodic changes, which, in turn, cause partial changes in the climate over many centuries.\\ n  Under the influence of the Moon and the Sun, the rotation period of the Earth is regularly increasing. The Moon's gravity causes deformations in the atmosphere, the water crust and the \"solid\" Earth. As a result of the Moon's gravity, the amplitude of the rise and fall of the Earth's crust is 43 cm, and in the open ocean it is a maximum of 2 m and in the atmosphere, the pressure varies up to several hundred N/m2 (several mm syst.). As a result of the friction that occurs during the ascent and descent, the Earth-Moon system loses energy, and the momentum of the movement is transferred from the Earth to the Moon. As a result, the rotation of the Earth slows down, and the Moon moves away from the Earth. The period of rotation of the Earth around its axis is increasing on average by several m/s per century (500 million years ago it was 20.8 hours per day). The speed of the Earth's rotation varies throughout the year as a result of seasonal changes in air masses and humidity. Since the Earth's poles are concave (the mass around the equator is greater) and the Moon's orbit does not lie in the plane of the Earth's equator, the Moon's gravity creates precession, that is, the Earth's axis slowly turns around the ecliptic axis in space and forms a complete cone surface once every 26 thousand years. Periodic oscillations of the direction of the axis - nutation (basic period 18.6 years) are also involved in this movement. The position of the axis of rotation relative to the Earth's body changes both periodically (where the poles deviate from the average position by 10-15 m) and over centuries, the average position of the North Pole moves towards North America by -11 cm per year (k,. Geographical poles).     The structure of the earth. Magnetosphere. The outermost and thickest crust of the Earth is the closest space to the Earth - the magnetosphere, whose physical properties depend on the Earth's magnetic field and the interaction of this field with the flow of cosmic particles. Observations by space probes and Earth satellites show that the Earth is constantly exposed to a stream of corpuscular particles (solar wind) coming from the Sun. The speed of the flow of these particles near the Earth's orbit reaches from 300 to 800 km/s. Solar plasma has a magnetic field with an average intensity of 4.8-10~3 a/m (6-10~5).    When the flow of solar plasma collides with the Earth's magnetic field, a shock wave appears, its distance from the center of the Earth is 13-14 It is equal to Re (Rfï¬ is the radius of the Earth), this wave is followed by a layer (intermediate area) with a thickness of 20,000 km. Particles move irregularly in the magnetic field of the solar plasma. In this area, the plasma temperature rises from 200,000 degrees to 10 million degrees.    The solar wind enters the magnetosphere through the intermediate zone. The boundary between the magnetosphere and the magnetopause, the dynamic pressure of the solar wind, is drawn from the place where the pressure of the Earth's magnetic field balances. It is 10-12 Rfï¬ (70-80 thousand km) from the center of the Earth, 100 km thick; magnetic field strength around the magnetopause is 8-10 2 a/m (10~3). As a result of solar activity, the magnetosphere changes. Due to the activity of the Sun, a significant change in the solar wind and its magnetic field occurs, that is, a magnetic storm appears. Due to the magnetic storm, the upper layer of the atmosphere heats up, the ionization of particles increases, they accelerate, the brightness of the aurora borealis increases, electromagnetic interference is generated, short-wave radio communication is disrupted, etc. k. The geomagnetic field creates the Earth's radiation region, which is dangerous for spacecraft to fly in.    Atmosphere. The atmosphere or the Earth's crust is the gaseous medium that surrounds the \"solid\" Earth and rotates with it. Mass, density, structure of the atmosphere, dissociation in the atmosphere, ionization, etc. is covered in the atmosphere article.    The main source of energy for the physical, chemical and biological processes occurring in the Earth's geographical crust, that is, the electromagnetic rays emitted by the Sun, pass through the atmosphere to the Earth's surface. The atmosphere absorbs x-rays and gamma-rays (short-wave rays) and the biosphereprotects it from harmful effects. Due to the presence of carbon dioxide and water vapor in the atmosphere, 48% of the solar radiation energy reaches the Earth's surface. The atmosphere contains (1.3-1.5) 1016 kg of water in the form of vapor, droplets and ice crystals. Without the atmosphere, the average annual temperature of the Earth's surface would be 23Â°C (actually, this temperature is 14.8Â°C).    The atmosphere traps a certain part of cosmic rays and protects the Earth from meteorite impacts. As the atmosphere heats up differently over land and sea, at different altitudes and latitudes, atmospheric pressure is also distributed differently. Due to this, general atmospheric circulation occurs. The circulation of water, precipitation and their flow are related to atmospheric circulation. Heat exchange, water circulation and atmospheric circulation are the main factors that create climate. The atmosphere plays an important role in various processes that occur on the land surface and in the upper layers of water bodies. The role of the atmosphere in the development of life on Earth is incomparable.    Hydrosphere. The water crust does not completely cover the Earth's surface. About 94% of the total volume of the hydrosphere is oceans and seas; 4% corresponds to underground waters, 2% to ice and snow (mainly in the Arctic, Antarctic and Greenland), 0.4% to dryland waters (rivers, lakes, swamps). The atmosphere and organisms also contain water. The amount of precipitation that falls on the Earth's surface in a year is equal to the amount of water that evaporates from the surface of land and oceans.    \"Solid\" Earth. About the structure, composition and properties of the \"solid\" Earth, only approximate information is available, since only the uppermost part of the Earth's crust can be directly observed. Information about the deepest layers of the Earth's crust was obtained by various indirect (mainly, seismology, gravimetry, geothermal, magnetometry, geophysics, measuring the frequency of Earth vibration, etc.) research methods. The most reliable of these is the seismic method based on the study of the paths and speeds of earthquake waves on the Earth. On the basis of these studies, it was proved that the Earth is made up of 3 geospheres: Earth's crust, mantle and core.    \"Solid\" Earth's upper part - the composition of the Earth's crust is extremely diverse and the most complex sphere. According to scientists, the Earth's crust is 20-80 km thick on land and 5-10 km deep in the oceans. In Central Asia, the thickness of the Earth's crust is 35 km in plains, 50-80 km in mountainous areas. The earth's crust is divided into several types; the most widespread of them are the continental and sub-oceanic Earth's crust. The continental Earth's crust consists of 3 layers: the upper - chukindi layer (from 10 km to 20 km), the middle - the conventionally called \"granite\" layer (from 10 km to 40 km) and the lower - \"basalt\" layer (from 10 km up to 80 km).    The thickness of the sedimentary layer in the oceans is usually several hundred m. The \"granite\" layer is very thin or completely absent. In its urn there is a \"second\" layer, which is 1-2.5 km thick and whose nature has not been determined. The thickness of the basalt layer is about 5 km. In addition to the main types of crust, there are also several types with an \"intermediate\" structure. These include subcontinental (under certain archipelagos) and suboceanic types (in continental interior and deep-water depressions of marginal seas). In the subcontinental crust, the \"granite\" and \"basalt\" layers are not so clearly separated from each other and are collectively referred to as the granite-basalt layer. The suboceanic crust is similar to the crust of the suboceanic Earth, but differs from it in total thickness, including the thickness of the crust. The Earth's crust is composed of 95% igneous, 5% sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Most mineral deposits are located underground. The Earth's mantle begins below the Earth's crust. The Earth's crust is separated from the mantle by the Mokhorovicic surface.    The mantle consists of 3 layers and extends to a depth of 2900 km, where it borders the Earth's core. Two layers are the upper mantle (850-900 km thick) and the third layer is the lower mantle (about 2000 km thick). The upper part of the 1st layer directly under the Earth's crust is called the substrate. Together with the substrate, the Earth's crust forms the lithosphere. The lower part of the upper mantle is called the Gutenberg mantle (asthenosphere) after the seismologist who discovered its properties. The propagation speed of seismic waves in the Gutenberg layer is higher and smaller than in the layers below. The asthenosphere is separated from the lower mantle by the Holicine layer. In the Golitsyn layer, the speed of seismic waves increases downwards (longitudinal waves reach 8-11.3 km/sec, transverse waves reach 4.9-6.3 km/sec) (see Earth's mantle). Now. In modern imaginations, the composition of the kura mantle is close to that of a stone meteorite. The mantle contains a lot of oxygen, silicon, magnesium, and iron.    Earth's core (with an average radius of 3.5 thousand km) is divided into an outer core and an inner or subcore with a radius of 1.3 thousand km.In the subcore, seismic waves propagate at almost the same speed. They are separated from each other by an intermediate zone about 300 km thick. Physical properties and chemical composition of \"Solid\" Earth. Density, pressure, gravity, elasticity of matter, elasticity and temperature change as you go deeper into the earth. The average density of the Earth's crust is 2.8, that of the sediment layer is 2.4-2.5, that of the \"granite\" layer is 2.7, and that of the \"basalt\" layer is 2.9 t/m3. At the boundary between the Earth's crust and the mantle (on the surface of Mokhorovichi), the density reaches from 2.9-3.0 to 3.1-3.5 t/m3. After that, the density gradually increases and suddenly reaches 10.0 t/m3 in the core, and then gradually decreases to 12.5 t/m3 in the center of the Earth.    The temperature in the crust and upper mantle decreases with depth. goes up towards A hot stream flows from the mantle to the top of the \"solid\" Earth; this flow is several thousand times less than the heat coming from the Sun.    The temperature everywhere in the mantle is lower than the complete melting temperature of the material in it. The temperature at the base of the continental Earth crust is close to 600-700Â°, and in the Gutenberg layer it is close to the melting point (1500-1800Â°). The deeper layers of the mantle and the core are roughly thought of. The temperature in the core probably does not exceed 4000-5000Â°, most researchers believe that the core contains more iron and nickel metals, others believe that the composition of the mantle and the core is the same, but the difference in their properties is due to phase transitions that occur at high pressure.    The upper mantle is up to 700 km deep. the presence of earthquake foci was determined. This indicates the strength of the material that makes up the mantle; the absence of deeper earthquake foci indicates that the material here is not strong enough or that there is not enough mechanical stress. The electrical conductivity of the substrate is very low; Gutenberg's (asthenosphere) layer is strong, which is believed to be due to the high temperature, and the lower mantle is probably even stronger. Conductivity in the Earth's core is very strong, which indicates the metallic properties of the substance in the core.    Hoz. cosmogonic hypotheses indicate that the chemical composition of the planets, their moons, and meteorites should be close to that of the Sun (see Geochemistry).    Almost half of the Earth's crust is composed of oxygen, and more than a quarter is composed of silicon. Aluminum, magnesium, calcium, sodium and potassium are also abundant. Oxygen, silicon, aluminum formed the most widespread compounds in the Earth's crust - silicate anhydride (SiO2) and aluminum oxide (A12O3).    Mantle mainly consists of heavy minerals rich in magnesium and iron. Compounds with SiO2 were formed from them. In the substrate, forsterite (Mg2Si04) is the most abundant, and the proportion of fayalite (Fe2Si04) increases in depth. It is assumed that these minerals were decomposed into oxides (SiO2, MgO, GeO) under the influence of high pressure in the lower mantle.    The aggregate state of substances in the interior of the Earth depends on the high temperature and pressure in the Earth's depths; in the absence of high pressure, the mantle would melt, so the entire mantle is in a solid crystalline state; only in the Gutenberg layer, since the effect of temperature is stronger than pressure, it is considered to be amorphous or partially dissolved. The outer core must be in a liquid (molten) state, because transverse seismic waves, which cannot propagate in a liquid, do not pass through the outer core. It is assumed that the formation of the Earth's magnetic field depends on the presence of a liquid outer core. The subcore must be rigid in any case (longitudinal waves generate transverse waves in the subcore as they approach the subcore boundary).    Geodynamic processes. The matter of the earth's geospheres is constantly moving and changing. These processes happen quickly in the liquid and gaseous crust. But the main core of the history of the development of the Earth is the relatively slow movements of the inner geospheres, which are composed of almost solid matter. The processes taking place inside and on the surface of the Earth are divided into 2 main groups: endogenous processes caused by internal energy (mainly radioactive decay) and exogenous processes caused by the energy of sunlight falling on the Earth. Endogenous processes are mainly characteristic of deep geospheres. In the lower parts of the Earth's crust, in the upper mantle and deeper, the movement, expansion, compression of very large bodies, transition from one phase to another, migration (migration) of chemical elements, circulation of heat and electric currents, etc. is happening. Under the influence of these processes, light components began to accumulate in the upper geospheres, and heavy components began to accumulate in the deep geospheres. As a result of endogenous processes affecting the Earth's crust, its parts sometimes move vertically and horizontally, the internal structure of the Earth's crust is deformed and changed. Of theseall are tectonic processes, and the place where these processes are manifested is called the tectonosphere. Interrelated with tectonic processes, magmatic processes also occur, as a result of which magma rises from below and flows out of fissures to the surface of the Earth in lava flows (volcanism). As a result of tectonic deformations (dislocations) and absorption of magma, rocks undergo the process of metamorphism - under the influence of high pressure and temperature, the open composition and structure of minerals change. Exogenous processes are weathering of rocks, erosion of eroded rocks by wind and running water, alteration of the earth's surface by rivers, streams, underground waters, glaciers, accumulation in land depressions, seas and lakes, and later transformation into sedimentary rocks.    Endogenous processes. and the effects of exogenous processes on the surface of the earth are opposite to each other. Endogenous processes (mainly, tectonic movements) create large depressions, and exogenous processes break up elevated areas, divide them, bring eroded products to lower areas, that is, try to level the earth's surface and maintain balance. As a result of the interaction of internal and external processes, various irregularities appear on the surface of the earth, as a result of which the relief of the earth's surface is formed. Depending on the difference in the ratio of internal and external forces, mountains, hills or plains are formed. Under the influence of endogenous processes, the rocks inside the Earth are exposed to its surface, undergo denudation and accumulation, and become one of the main sources of sedimentary rocks. When the Earth's crust sinks, sedimentary rocks enter the Earth's interior, are affected by endogenous processes, sometimes melt and turn into magma, and again come out to the surface of the Earth under the influence of tectonic movements.    The main features of the structure of the Earth's crust. The Earth's crust is the only geosphere of the inner geospheres that can be studied directly. Therefore, the study of the structure of the Earth's crust is important for thinking about the history of the development of the Earth as a whole, and not only the crust of the Earth. The Earth's crust consists of 2 main parts - the continental crust and the oceanic crust, of which the continental crust is better studied. The oldest part of the Earth's crust on the mainland. structural elements. (Tocambrian) platforms are tectonically less active (stable) vast landmasses. Most of the platform areas have been transformed into slabs covered with almost horizontal sedimentary rocks during geological history. Under them. a twisted foundation is located. Such a foundation consists of metamorphic rocks outcropped and folded in non-sedimentary shields, which have been breached by deep magmatic intrusions, mainly of granitic composition. Qad. platforms are separated from each other by active geosynclinal regions; geosynclinal regions consist of several geosynclinal systems. Geosynclinal regions are tens of thousands of km long, where the Earth's crust is thick, large-amplitude vertical folds occur, rocks are strongly folded, volcanic movements are active, and seismic movements are intense. more likely. Volcanism is rare in the wide and relatively flat ocean floor, seismic movements are slow, and vertical movements of the Earth's crust are slow. Such areas are called oceanic platforms. At the same time, there are zones of tectonic activity under the ocean, called oceanic rift zones, which extend across the oceans in the form of mid-ocean ridges. They have a lot of volcanism, strong seismicity and heat flow from the Earth's depths. A series of deep rift botiks have appeared in such places, the ridges of which are complicated by earth cracks. According to the mutual structural ratio of continental and sub-ocean crusts, they can be divided into 2 principally different types. The first, called the Atlantic type, is mainly characteristic of the Atlantic, Indian and Arctic Oceans. Here, the continental and oceanic boundary crosses the continental crust structures, and the transition from it to the sub-oceanic crust is abrupt, with the loss of the \"granite\" layer into the continental slope. The second, or Pacific type, belongs to the edges of the Pacific Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and islands of the Atlantic Ocean, the Southern Hebridean Islands and the Indonesian coast of the Indian Ocean. This includes Mesozoic and Cenozoic fold systems and now. It is characteristic that the current geosyn-clinals lie parallel to the edge of the continent. The transition zone contains geoanticlinal uplifts. Now. in the terrain, these appeared in the form of a mountain archipelago of islands. With these, the deep water of the remote seas ogeosynclinal folds in the form of sti butiks and low long oceanic troughs are located next to each other.    These features of the Pacific coast are often attributed to its antiquity. At present, there is no doubt that the Atlantic-type oceans are relatively young. Historical geol. according to data, at the end of the Paleozoic era, the continents of South America, Africa, Australia and Antarctica, Madagascar o. and height Together with the Indian platform, it formed a single continental massif called Gondwana. But during the Mesozoic, it was divided into pieces, as a result, Indian and Atlantic ocean botiks appeared. The universal recognition of this fact does not negate its various interpretations. Some scientists believe that this phenomenon is the result of \"oceanization\", that is, the transformation of the continental Earth's crust into the oceanic crust. At the same time, there are widespread opinions that the oceans are formed by the pushing of the continental blocks of the Earth's crust and the opening of the substratum. Such ideas about continental drift are confirmed on the basis of paleogeographical data. From the mobilist hypotheses put forward in the 60s of the 20th century, the so-called \"new global tectonics\" or \"plate tectonics\" hypothesis became widespread. These hypotheses are based on geophysical research conducted in the oceans. In it, it is assumed that the sub-ocean crust \"flows\" from the mid-ocean ridges in both directions, and as a result, the expansion of the ocean sediments.    Earth relief. The largest (planetary-scale) relief forms of the Earth correspond to the largest structural elements of the Earth's crust. Their morphological differences are determined by the difference in the structure and history of some parts of the Earth's crust and the direction of tectonic movements. These forms of the earth's relief, which appear mainly under the influence of internal (endogenous) processes, are called morphostructures.    The morphostructures on the planetary scale are relatively smaller, but they are still large morphostructures - some hills, mountain ranges, plateaus, butiks, etc. divided into relief forms. On top of these morphostructures, there are various small relief forms called morphosculptures, most of them formed under the influence of external forces. Morphostructures form large depressions on the Earth's surface, continental bulges and ocean depressions. The largest elements of land relief are plain-platform and mountain (orogenic) regions. and includes flat parts of young platforms and occupies about 64% of the land area. Most of the original plain surfaces occupy the area, they consist of layers of sedimentary rocks lying almost horizontally. Symmetry is observed in the location of these regions: in the Northern Hemisphere there are the plains of North America, Eastern Europe and Siberia, in the Southern Hemisphere there are the plains of South America (Brazil), Africa, Arabia and Australia. The platform plains have separate lowlands and hills, plateaus, plateaus and rather high mountain massifs. Plain-platform areas absolute, point. 100â300 m low areas (Eastern Europe, Western Siberia, Turan, North America) and elevated areas (400â1000 m) as a result of the most recent movements of the Earth's crust (Middle Siberian Plateau, African-Arabian plains, Indian plains and Australia and South A large part of the American plains) is divided. In the land relief, high plains are the majority.    Mountainous (orogenic) areas occupy about 36% of the land. These are divided into two types: young or epigeo-synclinal (in the Eurasian south, west of North and South America) mountains that appeared during the orogenic stage of the development of Cenozoic geosynclinal systems, and re-emerged or epiplatform mountains; they are tall on the earth's crust. It is formed by rejuvenating and reappearing as a result of further movements in the flattened or semi-eroded areas of folded areas (for example, Tianshan, Kunlun, mountains in southern Siberia and northern Mongolia, Rocky Mountains in North America, etc.).    The bottom of the oceans is divided into the following parts. : underwater edges of continents, zone of island arcs (or intermediate zone), ocean floor and mid-ocean ridges. The underwater edge of the continent (14% of the Earth's surface) includes the flat part (shelf) of the continental shelf region, the continental slope and the continental shelf at a depth of 2500 to 6000 m. The continental slope and the continental foot are separated from the aeolian part of the ocean floor, which is called the ocean floor, by continental ridges consisting of land and shelf.    Island arc zone. The ocean floor is not bordered by continental skirts in all regions of the Earth. The geosynclinal mode has been preserved until now in the western Pacific Ocean, the Malay Archipelago, the Antilles, the Scotia Sea, etc. areathere is a zone between the continent and the ocean floor. This zone is distinguished by the width of the ocean floor and the sharp alternation of uplifted and deeply depressed areas. Archipelagos of island arcs, marginal sea basins (for example, the Bering, Okhota, etc. seas), mountains and depressions, as well as deep underwater trenches are located in these areas. Island arcs (Kuril, Zond, Antilles, etc.) are raised from the water level in the form of a series of islands; Deep submarine trenches are long and curved depressions of the ocean floor at a depth of 7-11 km. Most of the original ocean floor (up to 40% of the Earth's surface) is a deep submarine (average depth of 3 -4 thousand m) occupied by plains. Flat (subhorizontal), kiya and bal. There are flat plains up to 1000 m. A large number of underwater mountains (volcanoes) rise up from the plains of the ocean floor.    The largest part of the underwater terrain is the mid-ocean ridges (up to 10% of the Earth's surface). Their common uz. More than 60 thousand km. They are steep elevations, from several tens of km to a thousand km wide, rising 2-3 km from the bottom of the neighboring basins. Some peaks of the ridges are raised from the ocean level in the form of volcanic islands (Tristan da Cunha, Buve, Santa Elena, etc.).    The structure of the Earth's surface is played by deep Earth cracks that completely cut through the Earth's crust and often reach the mantle. They divide the Earth's crust into large pieces that are well represented in the relief. Major Earth faults extend up to 1,000 km in latitude and sublatitude on the ocean floor. Such Earth faults crossed the mid-ocean ridges, separated them into segments displaced by 10-100 km relative to each other, and appeared in the relief in the form of hills, low depressions, and mountain ranges rising above them.    Morphosculptures. In the formation of morphosculptures, the role of rivers and temporary streams is great. Water formed widespread fluvial (erosional and accumulative) forms (river valleys, ravines, ravines, etc.). There are also many glacial forms. They are. and cad. related to the activity of glaciers. In Asia and North America, frozen lands (cryogenic) relief of various shapes have developed in places where rocks with long-glacial layers are scattered. In deserts and semi-deserts, arid landforms caused by physical weathering, wind and intermittent water flows are common.    Biosphere]]. The most important feature of the Earth as a planet is the presence of a biological shell, that is, the biosphere, whose composition, structure, and energy are closely connected with the activities of living organisms. Biosphere is the only part of the Earth. it includes not only the upper part where life is spread, but also parts of other geospheres where living matter penetrates and has changed again under the influence of its activity. For this reason, the biosphere is only a source of living organisms. not habitat, but cad. includes the environment. According to various sources, there are about 2.5 million species of living organisms on Earth. Plants make up only 1/5 of it. Among animals, arthropods are the first (more than 1,500,000 species), molluscs are the second (130,000 species), chordates (40,000 species) are the third, angiosperms are the first (350,000 species), fungi (100,000 species) are the second. However, the number of species does not always correspond to the number of individuals, because the number of individuals may be too high when there are few species of some systematic groups of plants and animals. For this reason, the concepts of biomass and biological productivity are used to describe flora and fauna. In terms of composition, biosphere material is divided into living (organisms), biogenic (products created by living organisms), biocos (also formed as a result of the combined effects of biological and inorganic processes) and kos (inorganic) substances (see Biosphere).    Geographic shell (landscape) crust), although not relatively thick, embodies the unique characteristics of the Earth. In this sphere, the 3 parts of the geosphere, the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, and the Earth's crust, connect and interact with each other. The landscape sphere absorbs the main part of the energy of sunlight and b. accepts cosmic influences. In it, radioactive decay inside the Earth, etc. tectonic movements occur under the influence of processes, minerals are recrystallized, etc. k.    Energies of various sources (mainly the Sun) are transformed into thermal, molecular, chemical, kinetic, potential, electrical energy in the landscape sphere, and as a result, heat from the Sun accumulates here and creates diverse conditions for living organisms (see Geographical crust ).    Geological history and evolution of life on earth. Geological history of the Earthdetermined based on the study of the geological structure and rock complex. The tallest on earth. the absolute age of the rocks is more than 4.5 billion years, and the age of the planet Earth is about 4.7 billion years. The origin and initial development of the Earth predates its geological history. Earth's geologic history is divided into two distinct periods: the Tocambrian (more than 3 billion years), which covers about 5/6 of Earth's history, and the Phanerozoic (see Phanerozoic Eon), which covers the last 570 million years. Tocambrian is divided into Archaean and Proterozoic. The Phanerozoic includes the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras (see Geochronology). (Tocambrian) platforms were formed 1500-1600 million years ago; these are Eastern Europe, Siberia (Russia) in Europe; China-Korea, South China and India, Africa, Australia, South America and North America (Canada), as well as Antarctica are platforms. Continents The history of the earth's crust consists of the formation history of geosynclinal regions consisting of geosynclinal systems (see Geosynclinal).    Many of the Phanerozoic geosynclinal systems were formed during tectonic cycles. Although the beginning and end of each of the tectonic cycles differ by tens of millions of years in different cases, these cycles are natural stages of the general evolution of the structure of the continental crust. Two of them, the Caledonian and Hercynian cycles, correspond to the Paleozoic era (570-248 million years ago). The Caledonian and Hercynian folds, which ended at the end of these cycles, formed the foundations of the largest Epipaleozoic age platforms. The subsequent tectonic history is often considered a single Alpine cycle (see Alpine folding). However, this cycle is also divided into several small cycles of independent importance in the development of certain parts of the Earth (Mesozoic cycle, real Alpine cycle, Cenozoic cycle). higher elevation at the end of the cycle) each time led to changes in the Earth's surface relief, transgression and regression. These periodic movements affected the nature of the sedimentary rocks as well as the climate, resulting in periodic changes in the climate. During the Paleozoic, Brazil, South Africa, India and Australia were periodically covered by ice. Several areas of the Northern Hemisphere were covered by ice during the last anthropogenic period.    In the first half of each tectonic cycle, more of the continents were floodedâmore of the platforms and geosyn-clinals were submerged. At first, more sandstones were deposited in the seas, and as the area of the seas expanded, the accumulation of limestones increased. By the middle of the cycle, as the Earth's crust rose more and more, the sea receded, and mountains appeared on land and geosynclines. At the end of the tectonic cycle, almost everywhere the continents were free of sea basins. The sedimentary rocks that occur in the botiks have also changed. Initially, marine sediments consisted of sand and clay, and in shallow and closed sea basins, hemogenous lagoon deposits (salt, gypsum) were formed from the evaporation of water. Since the conditions of sediment formation change periodically, sedimentary formations formed at the same stages of different tectonic cycles are similar to each other. This has led to the formation of sedimentary mineral deposits in several cases. For example, the largest coal deposits were formed during the phases of the Hercynian and Alpine cycles, when the Earth's crust was just beginning to rise. At the end of the tectonic cycles, large deposits of copper and potassium salt were formed.    The tectonic movements on the platforms increased several times during the geological history. This was especially evident at the end of the Neogene - the mountains that appeared at the end of the Caledonian or Hercynian cycles and were flattened (for example, the Tianshan, Altai, Sayan mountains, etc.) rose again on the platforms at this time; at the same time, large grabens - rift systems (Baikal rifts, East African grabens) were formed.    Due to the interaction of external and internal forces, the nature of the Earth's surface has changed throughout geological history. The relief, the shape of the continents and oceans, the climate, the flora and fauna have changed several times. The development of the organic world is closely related to the main stages of the Earth's development; Among these stages, along with long periods of relative peace, there were also periods when the natural conditions on the Earth's crust and surface changed for a short time.    The history of the development of the organic world. There are various hypotheses about the origin of life on Earth and its initial development period. According to most scientists, water was a body before biological evolutionamino acids, proteins, etc. there was a long chemical evolution associated with the formation of organic compounds. The original atmosphere did not contain oxygen. The atmosphere is mainly composed of methane, carbon dioxide, water vapor and hydrogen, with some oxygen. Due to evolution, primitive organisms gradually emerged from the first complex organic compounds. They are composed of protein and nucleic acid and are capable of genetic change (see Mutation). Under the influence of natural selection, only primitive organisms that were more refined and fed on organic matter survived (see Heterotrophic organisms). Later, organisms that could synthesize organic substances from inorganic substances through chemical synthesis and photosynthesis appeared (see Autotrophic organisms). Free oxygen formed due to photosynthesis began to accumulate in the atmosphere. With the origin of autotrophic organisms, there was a wide opportunity for the evolution of plants and animals.    The history of life is studied based on the fossilized remains of animals and plants preserved in rocks and the traces of their activities. Peking is incomplete because many organisms, especially those without skeletons, have completely disappeared.    Organisms are the oldest forms of life. traces were preserved in Archaean rocks that appeared 2.6-3.2 billion years ago and even earlier; they consist of the remains of bacteria and blue-green algae. Organic substances found in Proterozoic rocks are quite diverse. In the Lower Proterozoic, life products of algae (stromatolites) and bacteria (including iron bacteria formed by iron ore deposits) were found. The first multicellular animals appeared in the Proterozoic, because in the deposits at the end of the Proterozoic a number of animals without skeletons - clouds, jellyfish, corals, worms, etc. traces and nuclei of some organisms have been identified. The end of the Proterozoic is called the \"Age of Jellyfish\" due to the abundance of jellyfish fossils. There were also other organisms in the Proterozoic, because the remains and traces of representatives of almost all types of the entire animal world were found in the early Paleozoic deposits.    The appearance of organisms with organic or mineral skeletons at the border of the Early Cambrian and Phanerozoic was a very important event in the development of the organic world. A large number of organic remains in the Phanerozoic deposits allow us to learn how the history of the development of the organic world took place, as well as to divide it into certain stages (eras, periods, etc.), paleogeographic reconstruction (determining the boundaries of seas and continents, climate zones, the history of sea basins and materials allows to find out, to determine how and under what conditions organisms lived in the past.    Evolution was a process of adaptation to the environment, and genetic variability, struggle for survival, and natural selection were its main factors. Sometimes the organisms underwent very large qualitative changes (for example, warm-blooded organisms appeared). Evolution has generally been a transition from simple to complex forms; the development of the same organisms led to the extinction of the second same organisms that were not well adapted to the environment.    From the point of view of the organic world, the Paleozoic era is divided into two stages. In the first stage (Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian), marine organisms prevailed. The first vertebrates appeared in the Ordovician. At the end of the Silurian, real fishes with jawbones appeared. The second stage - in the middle Paleozoic, plants and animals living on land appeared and became widespread. At the beginning of the Devonian, the first insects and land-dwelling chelicerae (scorpions, spiders, and mites) appeared. In the Devonian period, especially, fish developed rapidly, so the Devonian period is sometimes called the \"age of fish\".    At the end of the Paleozoic (Carboniferous and Permian), various organisms, first of all, plants, began to occupy land. Trees appeared and multiplied. In the Middle and Late Carboniferous, 3 botanical-geographic regions: tropical, eastern. (Angara) wajan. (Gondwana) regions appeared. Along with plants, many animals living on land, first of all arthropods (insects), increased, and the first reptiles appeared. In the middle of the Permian period, the size of the seas decreased, and the area of the continents expanded. Open seeds - conifers are widespread.    Reptiles living in water at the beginning of the Mesozoic era - turtles, crocodiles, ichthyosaurs; land animals - the first dinosaurs, primitive mammals (trichonodonts) appeared. At the end of the Triassic period, sawflies, conifers, etc. increased. From the reptiles at the end of the Jurassic period. birds (Archeopteryx) originated.    During the Cretaceous period, toothed birds spread and giant dinosaurs appeared. Cretaceous periodAt the end of the century, many groups of organisms died out and changed.    At the beginning of the Cenozoic era, the organic world became more complex. Several birds and mammals appeared; warm-blooded birds with a complex brain are more independent and more adapted to life. Some mammals are adapted to live on land, others to sea, and some to fly. Tropical, subtropical and temperate botanical-geographic regions are clearly separated; in tropical and subtropical oblates, evergreen palms and woody ferns are the majority. Coniferous and broad-leaved forests are scattered in the temperate zone.    The end of the Paleogene and the beginning of the Neogene. animal-like invertebrates continued to evolve. Amphibians and reptiles are more advanced; birds spread over wider areas. At the beginning of the Neogene, three-legged horses, rhinoceroses, mastodons, giraffes, deer, predators (saber-toothed tigers, hyenas), tundra and taiga plants were formed in Western Europe. Grassland plains appeared in Europe and North America. During the anthropogenic period. flora and fauna continued to develop. The fauna and flora of the Northern Hemisphere changed a lot during the great glaciations. Some unique animals (mammoths, long woolly rhinoceroses) became pay-do and became extinct again. The emergence of man was the most important event of this period.    Man and Earth. According to the data, the oldest. humans appeared 2 million years ago (some scientists believe 1 million years ago). The question of the origin of man has not yet been conclusively resolved. Some scientists say that the first place of man was Africa, others - Eurasia. regions, and the third are considered to be Mediterranean countries. As early as the Early Paleolithic (see also Tout acpu) man in Central and Southern Europe. Lived in many parts of Africa and Asia; by the time of the Upper Paleolithic, he was physically weak. the modern type of man (Homo Sapiens - \"man with an act\") was formed, probably during this period, clan communities also appeared (see Anthropogenesis, Primitive community structure). During the Upper Paleolithic period, people began to spread over wider lands, including large areas of ice-free Europe and Asia; It reached the northeastern edges of Asia and entered North America. People began to migrate from South Asia to Australia and New Guinea. During the Mesolithic period, people settled on part of the coasts of Scotland and Scandinavia, the Baltic Sea, and the Arctic Ocean. Settled in the Japanese islands and Oceania during the Neolithic period.    Social i. Ch. in the process, a person affects the surrounding environment, changes it. There are different forms of human influence on nature. As a result of this effect, water resources are redistributed, the local climate changes, and some features of the relief take on a different form. The change of one of the components of the geographical landscape due to human influence leads to the change of other components. Natural conditions have a great influence on the direction of economic activity and many elements of culture (housing, clothing, food, etc.), but this influence is not decisive. There are ways to use nature wisely, purposefully, and brutally, without cruelty. In the first method, natural resources are protected and changed accordingly. The second attitude impoverishes nature and reduces its quality.    As a result of the scientific and technical revolution, the use of natural resources has been accelerated. Natural resources are divided into non-renewable (such as minerals) and renewable (such as soil, plants, animals) resources. For this reason, mankind has an important task to save the natural environment from extinction.    Hoz. at this time, the task of protecting the natural environment from pollution is of great importance; The natural environment is polluted mainly by dust, sulphite dioxide, carbon dioxide, ash and slag, metal compounds, used water, toxic drugs that are excessively applied to the soil by enterprises, electric plants, motor vehicles. Pollution of the environment by radioactive substances is especially dangerous. The issues of nature protection and rational use of natural resources are discussed at international conferences convened by the UN and UNESCO. In Uzbekistan, the issues of nature protection and restoration are considered to be of great national economic importance. Laws on nature protection have been adopted in the republic (see Natural resources and nature protection). At the beginning of Christ, there were 200 million people on earth. In the year 1000, the population of the earth was 275 million, in the 17th century it was 500 millionIt reached 2.5 billion in 1950, 3.6 billion in 1970, and 6 billion in 2000. The population is growing especially fast in the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This puts before those countries the issue of providing the population with food products. In order to fully provide the population with food, it is necessary to expand the cultivated areas, especially to increase the yield, and to increase the livestock products. Sea and ocean resources can also be a source of food. Therefore, keeping water clean is a matter of providing water to humanity. is one of the urgent issues (see Water resources). The shape of the Earth  The length of the meridian arc of the Earth's surface is shorter at the equator than at the polar circle. The length of one degree of meridian arc is 110.9 km at the equator and 111.9 km at the polar circle. The Earth is slightly compressed at the poles, the length of the polar axes is 12,714 km, the diameter at the equator is 12,756 km, and the radius is 6,371,221 km. So, the density of the earth is 12 kilometers. Accurate measurements carried out later showed that the Earth is close to an ellipsoidal shape. If it is taken into account that the difference in the length of the equatorial and polar axes is small, such an ellipsoid can be called a spheroid. But the surface of the earth does not conform to any known geometric shape. Taking into account that the height of the Jomolungma peak in the Himalayas is 8848 m above the ocean surface, the deepest point of the Pacific Ocean is 11521 m, and the change of the surface relief is more than 20 kilometers, it has a unique geoid shape. The surface of the Earth is 510 million square kilometers, the volume is 1.083*1012 km3, the mass is 5.974*1027 gr., the average density is equal to 5.52g*cm3. The structure and composition of the Earth's interior cannot be determined by correction, so it is indirectly determined using geophysical, seismological, gravimetric and astronomical methods. The average density of the most common substances on the Earth's surface is 2.7 g*cm3, which is less than the average density of the Earth.",

  "yulduzlar": "Stars",
  "yulduzlar_desc": "A star is a gravitationally bound ball of bright plasma. At the end of its life, a star can also contain degenerate matter. The closest star to Earth is the Sun, which is also the main source of energy on Earth. Other stars appear as fixed points of light from the surface of the Earth, unless obstructed by atmospheric phenomena. Historically, bright stars in the celestial sphere were grouped into constellations and asterisms, and the brightest ones were also given names. Astronomers have collected data about stars.    At least during some part of its life, the hydrogen in the core of a star glows due to the radiation of the energy of the fusion reaction. Almost all naturally occurring chemical elements heavier than helium were formed by nucleosynthesis in stellar radiation or explosions. Astronomers can determine a star's mass, age, chemical composition, and other properties by observing its spectrum, brightness, and motion in space. The mass of a star is the main criterion determining its evolution and fate. Other characteristics of a star are determined by its past, diameter, rotation, motion, and temperature. A chart showing the ratio of a star's temperature to its luminosity, or the HertzsprungâRussell diagram (H-R diagram), helps determine a star's age and evolutionary state.    A star begins with the collapse of a cloud of matter composed of hydrogen, which may also contain small amounts of helium and heavier elements. When the star's core becomes dense enough, some of the hydrogen is rapidly converted into helium by nuclear reactions.[1] The stellar mass outside the core transports energy from the core to the surface through radiation and convection processes. The internal pressure of the star keeps it from further collapse. When it runs out of hydrogen fuel, a star with a mass of at least 0.4[2] the mass of the Sun expands to become a red giant, and in some cases begins to produce heavier elements. The star then degenerates and ejects some of its material into the interstellar medium, where it forms new generations of stars with more heavy elements. consists of two or more stars rotating in fixed orbits. The evolution of such stars can be greatly influenced by their mutual gravitation. Stars can be included in larger gravitationally bound systems, such as clusters or galaxies.History of Observation    Humans have been observing the patterns that stars form since ancient times[4]. This painting depicting the constellation Leo in the form of a lion was painted by Johannes Hevelius in 1690[5].  Historically, the stars have been important to the world's civilizations. They were part of religious rituals and needed for astronomical navigation and wayfinding. Many ancient astronomers believed that the stars remained stationary in the celestial sphere. believed that. Astronomers collectively grouped the stars into constellations and used them to determine the location and movement of the planets and the Sun.[4] The movement of the sun relative to the background stars and the horizon was used to create calendars to regulate agriculture[6]. The Gregorian calendar used today is one such solar calendar, which is based on the ratio of the angle of the Earth's rotation axis to the Sun.    The oldest detailed star chart appeared in Egyptian astronomy in 1534 BC[7]. A contemporary Babylonian chart was prepared in Mesopotamia around 1531â1155 BC[8].    The first Greek star catalog was created by Aristiltus and Timocharis around 300 BC[9] Hipparchus star catalog (2nd century BC) contains 1020 stars taken and used in the compilation of Ptolemy's star catalog.[10] Hipparchus was also the first to observe a new star [11]. Today's names of most stars and constellations come from Greek astronomy.    Despite the idea that the sky does not change, Chinese astronomers were aware of the appearance of new stars[12]. In 185 AD, they were the first to record observations of the supernova now known as SN185[13]. The brightest stellar event in history was supernova SN 1006 observed by the Egyptian Ali ibn Ridwan and some Chinese astronomers in 1006.[14] Supernova SN 1054, the source of the Crab Nebula, was also observed by Chinese and Muslim astronomers.[15][16][17] .    Muslim astronomers in the Middle Ages gave the stars names that are still used today, and invented instruments to calculate the positions of the stars. They built the first large observatories and collected seeds.[18] Among these was the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rar, who observed stars, clusters (including the Omicron Velorum and the Brocchi Cluster), and galaxies (including the Andromeda Galaxy).The Book of Fixed Stars (964) written by Ahmad al-Sufi is included.[19] According to A. Zahoor, in the 11th century, Abu Rayhan Beruni from Khorezm described the Milky Way as consisting of stars with nebula characteristics and recorded the width of the stars during the lunar eclipse in 1019. [20]    Joseph Puig writes that Al-Andalus astronomer Ibn Bajja in 1106- Observing the opposition of Jupiter and Mars in the 1107s, he suggested that the Milky Way is made up of stars that almost touch each other and appear as a whole because their light bounces off material below the moon.[21]      This image shows Andromeda as a mirror image of Urania. . London, 1825  Early European astronomers such as Tycho Brahe saw new stars (which they called novae) in the night sky and suggested that the heavens were not fixed. In 1584, Giordano Bruno wrote that the stars were like the Sun, and that other planets, like the Earth, could revolve around it,[22] an idea that was previously held by the Greek philosophers Democritus and Epicurus,[23] and Islamic cosmologists[24] (including Fakhr al-Din al-Razi )[25] was introduced. By the 17th century, the assumption that the stars were like the Sun was approaching consensus among astronomers. To explain why these stars do not exert a significant gravitational influence on the Solar System, Isaac Newton assumed that the stars were equally distributed in all directions, a hypothesis supported by theologian Richard Bentley.[26]    The Italian astronomer Geminiano Montanari wrote in 1667 that he had observed changes in the brightness of the star Algol. . Edmond Halley measured the motion of a pair of \"fixed\" stars and showed that their position had changed since the time of Ptolemy and Hipparchus. The distance to the star was first calculated by Friedrich Bessel in 1838 using the parallax method (Swan 61, 11.4 light years away). Parallax measurements showed that the stars were spread very far apart.[22]    William Herschel was the first astronomer to attempt to determine the extent of the distribution of stars in the sky. In the 1780s, he took measurements in 600 directions and counted how many stars there were in each direction. Based on this, he came to the conclusion that the number of stars increases sharply towards the center of the Milky Way. His son John Herschel repeated this study in the southern hemisphere and came to the same conclusion.[27] William Herschel also discovered that some stars form pairs.    The science of stellar spectroscopy was founded by Joseph von Fraunhofer and Angelo Secchi. They compared the spectra of Sirius and other stars to that of the Sun and identified differences in absorption lines, with black lines indicating the absorption of specific frequencies. In 1865, Secchi began to classify stars according to their spectra.[28] However, modern star classification began in the 1900s by Annie J. Cannon.    During the 19th century, the importance of observing binary stars increased. In 1834, Friedrich Bessel observed the motion of Sirius and speculated that it had a hidden moon. Edward Pickering discovered the first spectral double star in 1899 by observing the separation of the spectral lines of the star Mizar with a period of 104 days. Observations of many binary star systems were collected by astronomers such as William Struve and S. W. Burnham, which allowed stellar masses to be determined by calculating orbital elements. Felix Savary was the first to solve the problem of deriving the orbit of binary stars from telescope observations in 1827.[29] In the twentieth century, the scientific study of stars developed dramatically. Photography became an important tool of astronomy. Carl Schwarzschild discovered that a star's color, which means its temperature, can be determined by comparing its star's magnitude to a photographic scale. The creation of a photoelectric photometer made it possible to accurately measure star sizes in different wavelength intervals. In 1921, Albert A. Michelson was the first to measure the diameter of a star using an interferometer at the Hooker telescope.[30]    Important conceptual work on the physical structure of stars began in the first half of the 20th century. In 1913, the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram was created, and stellar astrophysics advanced. Successful models have been developed that explain the internal structure and evolution of stars. The stellar spectrum has also been successfully explained thanks to developments in quantum physics. As a result, it became possible to determine the chemical composition of the atmosphere of stars.[31]    With the exception of supernovae, individual stars were mainly observed in our local group of galaxies,[32] especially in our Milky Way.[33] But some stars have been observed in the M100 galaxy in the Spire cluster, 100 million light-years away from Earth.[34] Clusters of stars can be observed in the local supercluster, and individual stars millions of light-years away with modern telescopescan observe [35] (for example, Cepheida). However, neither individual stars nor clusters were observed outside the local supercluster. The only exception is a faint image of a vast cluster of hundreds of thousands of stars a billion light-years away.[36]    Nomenclature  Main article: Nomenclature of stars  The concept of constellations existed as far back as Babylonian times. Ancient sky watchers imagined the location of the stars in the form of patterns and spread these lines in their mysteries. Twelve of these patterns lie on the ecliptic band and form the basis of astrology.[37] Many obvious stars were also given special names in Arabic or Latin.    Not only specific constellations and the Sun itself, but stars in general have their own mysteries.[38] To the ancient Greeks, certain \"stars\" (actually planets) represented various important deities, and based on these views, they named the celestial bodies Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.[38] Uranus and Neptune are also names of Greek and Roman gods, but these planets were not known at the time and were discovered later.    In the 1600s, constellation names were used to name the stars in their respective regions of the sky. German astronomer Johann Bayer created a series of star maps, using Greek letters to designate the stars in each constellation. Later, a numbering system based on the star's right aperture was invented and added to John Flamsteed's star catalog in his book Historia coelestis Britannica (1712), and this system came to be known as Flamsteed designation or Flamsteed numbering.[39][40]    Space The International Astronomical Union (IAU) is the only body authorized to name celestial bodies under its own right.[41] A number of private companies sell star titles in what the British Library has called an unregulated trade. [42] [43] However, XAI refrains from such commercialization, the names are neither recognized nor used by XAI. [44] Arbitrarily naming celestial bodies and selling those names as \"official\" is fraud. [45] [46] [47] [48]    Units  Although stellar parameters can be expressed in SI or SGS units, it is more convenient to express mass, luminosity, and radii in terms of the characteristics of the Sun:    Solar mass:   tMâ = 1.9891 Ã 1030 kg[49]  Solar luminosity:\\tLâ = 3.827 Ã 1026 watts[49]  Solar radius:\\tRâ = 6.960 Ã 108 m[50]  Red giant radius or semi-major axis of a binary star Longitudes as large as 2 are usually expressed in terms of the astronomical unit (AB)âthe average distance between the Earth and the Sun (150 million km).    Formation and evolution  Main article: Stellar evolution  Stars form in vast regions of high density in the interstellar medium, but this density is still the atmosphere inside the vacuum chamber on earth is rarer. These regions are called molecular clouds, which consist mainly of hydrogen, 23-28% helium, and small amounts of heavier elements. An example of such a star-forming region is the Orion Nebula.[51] As massive stars form from such molecular clouds, they strongly illuminate these clouds. They also ionize hydrogen, creating the H II region.    Protostar formation  Main article: Star formation  Star formation is initiated by massive starbursts in a molecular cloud, gravitational instabilities caused by the collision of different molecular clouds or galaxies. When the region reaches a density that satisfies the criterion of gravitational instability, it begins to compress under its own gravitational force.[52]      A star birth in a dense molecular cloud in the artist's imagination. NASA image  As the cloud compresses, dense clumps of dust and gas form globules. When the globule is compressed and the density increases, the gravitational energy is converted into heat and the temperature rises. When a protostellar cloud reaches stable hydrostatic equilibrium, a protostar forms at the center of the cloud.[53] Before this main sequence, stars are often surrounded by a protoplanetary disk. The period of gravitational compression lasts 10-15 million years.    Early stars with a mass less than 2 solar masses are called T Tauri, and those with a mass greater than this are called Herbig Ae/Be stars. These newborn stars emit gas streams along their spin axes, which can reduce the angular momentum of the collapsing star and produce small nebulae called Herbig-Haro objects.[54][55] These flows, along with radiation from nearby stars, can disintegrate the star-forming cloud.[56]    Main sequence  Main article: Main sequence  Stars spend 90% of their lives converting hydrogen to helium in high-temperature and high-pressure reactions close to the core. spends with synthesizing. Such stars are located in the main sequence and are called dwarf stars. Helium ratio in the stellar core starting from the zero-age main sequencewill increase. As a result, the star gradually increases in temperature and luminosity to keep up with the rate of fusion at the core[57]âfor example, the Sun is estimated to have increased in luminosity by 40% after reaching the main sequence 4.6 billion years ago.[58]     Each star emits a wind of particles, continuously spewing gas into space. For most stars, this mass loss is negligible. The Sun loses 10â14 of its mass per year,[59] and 0.01% of its mass during its lifetime. However, very massive stars can lose 10â7 to 10â5 solar masses per year, which severely affects their evolution.[60] Stars 50 or more times the mass of the Sun can lose more than half their mass during the main sequence.[61]      An example of a HertzsprungâRussell diagram for a cluster of stars that includes the Sun.  The time a star is on the main sequence is basically proportional to the amount of fuel it can fuse and the rate of fusion, that is, its initial mass and luminosity. The calculation done for the Sun shows a period of 1010 years. Massive stars burn their fuel quickly and are short-lived. Small stars (red dwarfs) burn their fuel very slowly and live for tens or hundreds of billions of years. At the end of their lives, they simply fade away.[2] Since the lifetime of such stars is longer than the age of the universe (13.7 billion years), stars with a mass less than 85% of that of the Sun,[62] including all red dwarfs, have not yet reached the end of the main sequence.    Elements heavier than helium in the evolution of stars may also play an important role. In astronomy, all elements heavier than helium are considered \"metals\", and the chemical concentration of these elements is called metallicity. Metallicity can affect the ignition timing of the star's fuel, control the formation of magnetic fields,[63] and change the strength of the stellar wind.[64] Older, Generation II stars tend to have much lower metallicities than younger, Generation I stars due to the composition of the molecular cloud around them (as older stars decay and tear apart their atmospheres over time, these clouds become filled with heavier elements).    After the main sequence  Main article: Red giant  As stars with at least 0.4 solar masses[2] exhaust their hydrogen reserves in their cores, their outer layers expand and cool significantly, turning the star into a red giant. For example, after about 5 billion years, when the Sun becomes a red giant, its maximum radius will expand to about 1 AU (150 million km; 250 times its current size). As a giant, the Sun loses 30% of its current mass.[58][65]    2.25 In a red giant, hydrogen fusion continues in the mantle surrounding the core until the mass of the Sun reaches 2.25.[66] As a result, the core is strongly compressed, helium fusion begins in it, and the star gradually shrinks, increasing the surface temperature. In even larger stars, the core switches directly from hydrogen fusion to helium fusion.[67]    After the star has finished burning the helium in the core, fusion continues in the outer shell of carbon and oxygen. The star then continues to evolve like a red giant, but with a higher surface temperature.    Massive stars  Main article: Red supergiant  During the helium burning phase, very massive (>9 solar masses) stars expand to become red supergiants. Once the helium is depleted, they can continue to fuse heavier elements from helium.    The core is compressed until the temperature and pressure are sufficient to fuse carbon. This process continues and passes through the stages of synthesizing neon, oxygen and silicon. At the end of a star's life, fusion can also occur in stellar shells. Each shell synthesizes a different element: the outermost shell hydrogen, the shell below it helium, etc.[68]    The final stage of a star begins with the synthesis of iron. Due to the fact that the nuclei of iron atoms are tightly bound, their fusion does not release energy, but on the contrary, absorbs energy. For this reason, even if iron nuclei split, no energy is released.[66] Inert iron accumulates in the center of relatively old, very massive stars. Heavier elements in these stars can leak to the surface and form an object known as a Wolf-Rayet star, whose atmosphere is ripped apart by strong winds.    Collapse  A medium-sized evolved star tears off its outer layers and forms a planetary nebula. If the remnant after dispersal of the outer atmosphere is 1.4 times the mass of the Sun, it turns into a relatively dwarf (Earth-like) object, such an object is called a white dwarf, and due to its low mass, compression does not occur.[69] The degenerate material inside the white dwarf is no longer plasma. White dwarfs eventually become black dwarfs after a very long time.      The Crab Nebula, first observed around 1050observed supernova remnants.  In larger stars, fusion continues until the iron core becomes so massive (>1.4 solar masses) that it cannot support its own mass. This nucleus is pushed into its protons by its electrons, forming neutrons and neutrons as a result of electron capture (inverse beta decay). The shock wave created by such a sequence of sudden compression (collapse) explodes the rest of the star, forming a supernova. Supernovae are so bright that they can temporarily block out the star's entire parent galaxy with its brightness. Supernovae observed in the Milky Way are easily detected by the naked eye.[70]    Most of the stellar material is dispersed by the explosion to form a nebula (such as the Crab Nebula)[70] and the remnant is a neutron star that manifests itself as a pulsar or burster. if the remnant mass is 4 or more times that of the Sun, it becomes a black hole.[71] Matter in a neutron star is called neutron-degenerate matter, and exotic quark matter can accumulate in its core. There is currently no information about the substance inside a black hole.    The outer layers ejected from dying stars contain heavy elements that can be recycled during the formation of a new star. Such heavy elements allow the formation of rocky planets. Explosive matter and stellar winds from a supernova play an important role in shaping the interstellar medium.[70]    Distribution    A white dwarf in its orbit around Sirius (artist's rendering). Image by NASA  In addition to single stars, the universe contains two or more gravitationally bound multiple star systems that orbit each other. The most common multiple star is a double star, but systems with three or more stars have also been found. Due to orbital stability, such stars are often arranged in a hierarchy of inter-rotating binaries.[72] There are also larger groups called star clusters. They range from empty clusters of a few stars to giant globular star clusters of hundreds of thousands of stars.    Most stars have long been thought to be in gravitationally bound binary systems. This is true for massive O- and B-class stars, which are thought to make up 80% of such stars in star systems. However, smaller stars exist in isolation, with only 25% of red dwarfs having satellites. Since 85% of all stars are red dwarfs, most of the stars in the Milky Way can be said to be solitary.[73]    Stars are not evenly distributed in the universe, but are packed into galaxies with interstellar gas and dust. A typical galaxy consists of hundreds of billions of stars, with over 100 billion (1011) galaxies in the observable universe.[74] According to a 2010 estimate, the number of stars reaches 300 sextillion (3 Ã 1023).[75] Stars have also been discovered outside galaxies (in intergalactic space).[76]    The closest star to Earth after the Sun is Proxima Centauri, which is 39.9 trillion km or 4.2 light years away. Traveling at orbital speed (8 km/sâalmost 30,000 km/h), the space shuttle would take about 150,000 years to get there.[77] Such distances are common within the galactic disk, including the Solar System.[78] Stars can be closer together in globular star clusters and galactic centers, and farther apart at the galactic edges.    Due to the rarity of stars outside the galactic core, stellar collisions are thought to be rare. In denser regions, such as the center of a cluster or galaxy, collisions may be more frequent.[79] Such collisions can form blue dwarf stars. Such rare stars are as bright as other main-sequence stars, but have higher surface temperatures.[80]    Description  Almost all properties of a star, including luminosity, size, evolution, lifetime, and fate, are determined by its initial mass.\\ n  Age  Most stars are 1-10 billion years old. The age of some stars is even 13.7 billion - close to the age of the universe. The oldest star discovered, HE 1523-0901, is 13.2 billion years old.[81][82]    The more massive the star, the shorter its lifespan, because massive stars put more pressure on their cores, forcing them to burn hydrogen faster. . While the most massive stars live for a few million years, the minimum mass stars (red dwarfs) use up their fuel very slowly and live for tens or hundreds of billions of years. % hydrogen, 27% helium,[85] and small amounts of other elements. The proportion of heavy elements in stellar atmospheresis measured by the amount of iron in it, because it is widespread and the absorption lines are relatively clearly defined. The age of a star can be deduced from its chemical composition, since the molecular clouds in which stars are formed are saturated with heavy elements during supernova explosions.[86] The fraction of heavy elements also indicates the probability that a star has a planetary system.[87]    The least iron-rich star is HE1327-2326, which has only 1/200,000 the amount of iron in the Sun.[88] In contrast, the metal-rich star m Leonis has twice as much iron as the Sun, and the planet 14 Herculis has nearly three times as much iron.[89] There are also special stars whose spectrum shows an abundance of elements such as chromium and rare earth elements.[90]    Diameter    Stars vary greatly in size. In each image above, the object on the right is equivalent to the object on the left in the next panel. The Earth is on the right in panel 1, and the Sun is on the right in panel 3.  Because of their great distance from Earth, all stars outside the Sun appear to the human eye as points of light twinkling in the night sky under the influence of the Earth's atmosphere. The Sun is also a star, but it is close enough to Earth to appear as a disk and give off daylight. The brightest star outside the Sun is R Doradus, which has an angular diameter of 0.057 arcseconds.[91]    Most stars' disks are too small in angular size to be observed with modern ground-based telescopes, so they are observed with interferometer telescopes. Another way to measure stellar angular magnitude is by occultation. A star's angular diameter is calculated by measuring the star's diminution when it is obscured by the Moon.[92]    Stars range in size from neutron stars 20â40 km in diameter to supergiants such as Betelgeuse, 650 times the diameter of the Sun (900,000,000 km). However, Betelgeuse's density is much lower than that of the Sun.[93]    Kinematics  Main article: Stellar kinematics    Hulkar is a sparse cluster in the constellation Taurus. These stars move together in space.[94] NASA photo  A star's motion relative to the Sun can provide useful information about a star's origin and age, as well as the structure and evolution of its surrounding galaxy. Stellar motion includes radial velocity from or toward the Sun and angular motion, called its own motion.    Angular velocity is measured using the doppler effect of the star's spectral lines and is expressed in km/s. A star's own motion is measured precisely astrometrically in milliarcseconds per year. By determining the parallax of a star, it is possible to infer its velocity from its own motion. High-motion stars tend to be closer to the Sun, which is convenient for parallax measurements.[95]    Once both values of the motion are determined, the star's spatial velocity relative to the Sun or the galaxy can be calculated. In closer stars, the velocity of new, generation I stars was observed to be lower than that of older, generation II stars. Older stars move in elliptical orbits that flow into the galactic plane.[96] A comparison of the kinematics of closer stars has also revealed star mergers. These are probably stars that formed in a single molecular cloud.[97]    Magnetic field  Main article: Stellar magnetic field    The surface magnetic field of SU Aur (a young T Tauri star), rendered using Zeeman-Doppler visualization.  Stellar magnetic field it is formed in the regions where there are convective currents inside it. This motion of the conductive plasma creates a dynamo-like magnetic field that extends beyond the star. The magnetic field strength depends on the star's mass and structure, and the surface magnetic activity depends on the star's rotation speed. Such surface activity creates cooler regions of strong magnetic fields called starspots. Arc-shaped magnetic fields known as coronal ridges can emanate from active regions into the star's corona. Eruptions of high-energy particles due to this magnetic field are called starbursts.[98]    Young, rapidly rotating stars are observed to have a high level of surface activity due to their magnetic fields. The magnetic field can affect the stellar wind, slowing its rotation as the star ages. As a result, old stars like the Sun rotate more slowly and have relatively less surface activity. The activity level of slow-rotating stars may change periodically and may be extinguished for a period of time.[99] For example, during the Maunder minimum, the Sun experienced almost no flares for 70 years.    Mass  Main article: Stellar mass  One of the most massive stars known to us is Eta Carinae,[100] which is 100â150 times the mass of the Sun; its life span is very short - only a few million years. 150 solar masses in the current universe as a result of the study of the Arches clusterfound to be the largest mass for stars.[101] The reason for this limitation is not fully known, the Eddington limit, which determines the maximum value of radiation without releasing gases from the atmosphere into space, is assumed to be the reason. However, a star named R136a1 (in the cluster RMC 136a) has been found to be 265 times more massive than the Sun, challenging such a limit.[102] The study found that the massive stars in R136 were formed by collisions and mergers of binary stars, which allowed them to expand beyond the 150 solar mass limit.[103]      The NGC 1999 return nebula is illuminated by the central 3.5 solar mass variable star V380 Orionis. The patch of black sky is not a dark nebula as previously thought, but just a huge void. NASA photo  The first stars formed after the Big Bang may have been up to 300 solar masses or more, as they did not contain lithium or heavier elements.[104] It is assumed that these supermassive III generation stars no longer exist.    With a mass 93 times that of Jupiter, AB Doradus is the lightest star undergoing nuclear fusion in its C core.[105] The theoretical minimum mass for stars with solar metallicity and cores still undergoing fusion is about 75 Jupiter masses.[106][107] At very low metallicity, the minimum mass can be 8.3% of the mass of the Sun.[107][108] Even smaller objects, called brown dwarfs, lie in the ill-defined region between gas giants and stars.    A star's radius and mass determine its surface gravity. While giant stars produce much weaker surface gravity than main-sequence stars, degenerate, dense stars like white dwarfs produce a stronger gravitational field. Surface gravity can affect a star's spectrum, for example, strong gravity causes absorption lines to broaden.[31]    As stars reach the end of nuclear fusion, they are sometimes grouped by mass based on their evolutionary pattern. Very low-mass stars lighter than 0.5 solar masses evolve directly into white dwarfs without entering the giant asymptotic grid (GAT). Low-mass stars of 1.8-2.2 solar masses enter the GAT and form a helium core. Medium-mass stars undergo helium fusion and form a carbon-oxygen core. Massive stars of at least 7â10 solar masses undergo carbon fusion and die in supernova explosions.[109]    Rotation  Main article: Stellar rotation  The rate at which stars spin around their axis is estimated spectroscopically by observing the rotation of starspots. and can be calculated more accurately. Young stars rotate rapidly, and the speed at their equator can exceed 100 km/s. For example, an Achernar B-class star rotates equatorially at 225 km/s or faster, with centrifugal force stretching and flattening its equatorial diameter by 50% relative to its polar diameter. Such rotation is slightly slower than the critical speed of 300 km/s at which a star breaks apart.[110] For comparison, the period of rotation of the Sun around its axis is 25-35 days, and the equatorial speed is only 1,994 km/s. The rotation of main-sequence stars is significantly slowed down by the magnetic field and the stellar wind.[111]    Compact stars are strongly compressed due to their rapid rotation around their axis. However, they rotate more slowly compared to the speed resulting from conservation of angular momentumâincreasing rotational speed to compensate for the reduction in size of the rotating body. Most of the stellar angular momentum is reduced by mass loss due to the stellar wind.[112] However, the pulsar's rotation speed can be very high. For example, the pulsar at the center of the Crab Nebula rotates 30 times per second.[113] The pulsar's rotation speed gradually slows down due to radiation.    Temperature  The surface temperature of a main sequence star depends on the rate of energy production in its core and its radius, and is determined by the star's color index.[114] It is usually given as the effective temperature, which is the temperature of an ideal blackbody that radiates its energy as brightly as a star. It should be noted that the effective temperature is only an average temperature, since the temperature of stars decreases from the core to the atmosphere.[115] The temperature in the core of the star reaches several million kelvins. [116]    The temperature of the star determines the rate of energization or ionization of various elements and forms characteristic absorption lines in the spectrum. A star's surface temperature, along with its absolute stellar magnitude and absorption properties, are used to classify a star.[31]    Massive main-sequence stars have surface temperatures of up to 50,000 K. Smaller stars like the Sun have surface temperatures of several thousand Kelvin. Red giants ratiocolder - their surface temperature is around 3,600 K, but due to their large surface area, their brightness is also high.[117]    Radiation  Energy is released by stars as a by-product of nucleosynthesis and spreads into space as both electromagnetic radiation and particle radiation. Particle radiation is manifested as the stellar wind[118] (which consists of charged particles such as free protons, alpha and beta particles emitted from the star's outer layer) and neutrinos emitted from the core. gamma radiation photons are emitted. This energy is converted to other forms of electromagnetic energy, including visible light, before it reaches the star's outer layer.    A star's color, determined by the peak frequency of visible light, depends on the star's outer layers, including the photosphere.[119] In addition to visible light, stars also emit electromagnetic radiation invisible to the human eye. In general, stellar electromagnetic radiation covers the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from radio frequency and infrared to ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma radiation. All components of a star's electromagnetic radiation are important.    Using stellar spectra, astronomers can determine a star's surface temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and rotation rate. If the distance to the star is known, its brightness can be calculated. Mass, radius, surface gravity, and rotation period can be determined from existing stellar models (masses of binary stars can be derived directly; stellar masses are also calculated by gravitational microlensing).[120] With these parameters, astronomers can also calculate the age of a star.[121]    Brightness  In astronomy, the term luminosity refers to the amount of light and other radiation energy emitted by a star per unit of time. A star's brightness depends on its radius and surface temperature. However, the radiation of most stars is not in a uniform stream. For example, the energy flow is stronger at the poles of the fast-rotating star Vega than at its equator.[122]    Areas of below-average temperature and brightness are called starspots. In the disk of a dwarf star as small as the Sun, such spots are sparse and small. Larger, giant stars tend to have larger and more prominent spots,[123] and darker terminators. That is, the brightness decreases towards the star disk.[124] Red dwarf flares such as UV Ceti can also have prominent spots.[125]    Stellar magnitude  Main article: Apparent stellar magnitude  Main article: Absolute stellar magnitude  A star's apparent brightness is measured by its apparent stellar magnitude (or magnitude). Apparent magnitude is the apparent brightness of a star from Earth. There is also a measure called the absolute magnitude of a star, which tells us how bright it appears to Earth when the distance between the star and Earth is 10 parsecs (32.6 light years).   0\\t4  1\\t15  2\\t48  3\\t171  4\\t513  5\\t1,602  6\\t4,800  7\\t14,000  Star magnitudes are on a logarithmic scale: one difference in star magnitude is luminosity. 2.5 times[127] (the 5th power root of 100 is about 2.512) means it differs. Therefore, a star of first magnitude (+1.00) is 2.5 times brighter than a star of second magnitude (+2.00) and 100 times brighter than a star of sixth magnitude (+6.00). The faintest star visible to a sharp-eyed person in clear air is magnitude +6.    The lower the magnitude number, the brighter the star, and vice versa. The brightest stars have negative magnitudes (less than 0). To calculate the difference (DL) between the luminosities of the two stars, subtract the magnitude (mp) of the fainter star from the magnitude (mx) of the brighter star and add 2.512 base numbers to the resulting difference:    D  ï¿½  =  ï¿½  x  â   ï¿½  p  {displaystyle \\\\Delta {m}=m_{\\mathrm {x} }-m_{\\mathrm {p} }}  2  ,  512  D  ï¿½   =  D  ï¿½  {\\\\displaystyle 2.512^{\\Delta {m}}=\\\\Delta {L}}  Depending on brightness and distance from Earth, absolute magnitude (M) is not equivalent to apparent magnitude (m); [127] for example, Sirius has an apparent magnitude of â1.44 and an absolute magnitude of +1.41.    The Sun has an apparent magnitude of â26.7, but an absolute magnitude of only +4.83. Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, is about 23 times brighter than the Sun, while Canopus, the second brightest star in the night sky (absolute magnitude -5.33), is 14,000 times brighter than the Sun. Canopus is much brighter than Sirius, but Sirius appears brighter to Earth. This is because Sirius is 8.6 light-years away from Earth, and Canopus is much further - 310 light-years away.    As of 2006the star with the largest absolute magnitude is LBV 1806-20, which has a magnitude of â14.2. This star is at least 5,000,000 times brighter than the Sun.[128] The least luminous stars known to us are located in the cluster NGC 6397. The faintest red dwarf in this cluster is magnitude 26, as well as a white dwarf of magnitude 28. These stars are so dim that their luminosity is as bright as a candle lit on the moon when viewed from Earth.[129]    Classification  Surface temperature differences for different classes of stars[130]  Class\\tTemperature\\tStandard star  O\\t33,000 K or more\\tZeta Ophiuchi  B\\t10 500â30 000 K\\tRigel  A\\t7 500â10 000 K\\tAltair  F\\t6 000â7 200 K\\tProcyon A  G\\t5 500â6 000 K\\tSun  K\\t4 000â5 250 K \\tEpsilon Indi  M\\t2 600â3 850 K\\tProxima Centauri  Main article: Classification of stars  Modern star classification began in the early 20th century, dividing stars into classes A through Q based on the strength of the neutral hydrogen radio line. [131] At the time, it was not known that the hydrogen line was greatly affected by temperature; the hydrogen line peaks around 9000 K and weakens at higher or lower temperatures. The classification was rearranged according to temperature and came close to the modern one. [132]    Stars are divided into different classes designated by one letter according to their spectra, O is the hottest star class, and M class star is so cold that molecules can form in its atmosphere. The classes of surface temperature reduction are as follows: O, B, A, F, G, K and M. There are special classes for rare spectrum types. The most common of these are L and T, which include the coolest low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Each letter has 10 sub-divisions from 0 to 9 in decreasing temperature. However, this system breaks down at extremely high temperatures: O0 and O1 stars may not exist.[133]    Stars can also be classified according to their effects on the brightness of their spectral lines, which depends on their size and surface gravity. These range from 0 (hypergiants) and III (giants) to V (main sequence dwarfs); some scientists also add class VII (white dwarfs). Most stars belong to the main sequence, engaged in hydrogen fusion. When graphed by absolute stellar magnitude and spectral type, such stars fall into a narrow, diagonal line.[133] The Sun is a main-sequence G2V yellow dwarf of moderate temperature and size.    Additional lowercase nomenclature is used to denote interesting spectral features. For example, there are \"e\" emission lines; \"m\" indicates high metallicity, and \"var\" indicates varying spectral type.[133]    White dwarf stars are placed in a separate class beginning with the letter D. This class is further divided into DA, DB, DC, DO, DZ and DQ classes according to the spectrum lines. A temperature indicator is also added to the name of these classes.[134]    Variable stars  Main article: Variable star    Asymmetric view of the oscillating variable star Mira. Image by NASA HST  Variable stars have periodic or random changes in brightness due to intrinsic or extrinsic properties. Internal variable stars are divided into three main groups.    During their evolution, some stars go through a pulsating variable star phase. Pulsating stars change their radius and luminosity periodically, from a few minutes to several years, depending on their size. This category includes Cepheid-like stars and long-period Mirida stars.[135]    Eruptive variables are stars that increase in brightness due to flash or massive eruption events.[135] This group includes protostars, Wolf-Rayet and flaring stars, and giants and supergiants.    Cataclysmic or explosive variables change their properties dramatically. This group includes new and super-new stars. A binary star system containing a white dwarf can experience nova and type 1a supernovae.[67] The explosion occurs when the white dwarf pulls hydrogen from a neighboring star to a mass where fusion begins.[136] Some new stars are recurrent and undergo periodic bursts of medium amplitude.[135]    External factors such as eclipsing binaries and rotating stars producing strong spots can also cause changes in the brightness of stars.[135] An example of an eclipsing binary star is Algol, whose magnitude varies between 2.3 and 3.5 with a period of 2.87 days.    Structure  Main article: Star structure  A stable star's interior is in hydrostatic equilibrium: any small amount of forces compensate each other. The balancing forces are gravitational forces directed inward of the star and gradient pressure forces directed outward. Pressure gradiententi is determined by the plasma temperature gradient; the outer parts of a star are cooler than its core. The temperature in the core of a main-sequence or giant star is at least 107 K. In a main-sequence star, the temperature and pressure in the hydrogen-burning core are sufficient to cause fusion and prevent stellar collapse.[137][138]    Atom inside a star As their nuclei decay, they release energy in the form of gamma radiation. These photons interact with the surrounding plasma and increase the thermal energy of the nucleus. Main-sequence stars turn hydrogen into helium and gradually accumulate helium in their cores. As a result, the amount of helium increases and the energy release in the core stops. In stars with 0.4 or more solar masses, the reaction moves to a slowly growing degenerate shell surrounding the helium core.[139]    In addition to hydrostatic equilibrium, thermal equilibrium is also maintained within a stable star. A continuous temperature gradient flows from the inside out, keeping thermal energy constant in each layer.      This diagram shows a cross section of a Sun-type star. NASA image  The region inside the star that holds the energy flow is called the radiation region. In this region, there is no plasma perturbation and any mass movements are stopped. Otherwise, the plasma becomes unstable, convection begins, and the region becomes a convection zone. This can occur in regions of very high energy fluxes, such as near the core or in high opacity layers.[138]    The presence or absence of convection in the outer layer of a main-sequence star depends on its mass. In stars several times more massive than the Sun, the convection region is deep inside, and the radiation region is in the outer layers. In contrast, in smaller stars such as the Sun, the region of convection is located further out.[140] Lighter than 0.4 solar masses, red dwarfs are completely convective, which prevents them from accreting a helium core.[2] In many stars, the location of convective regions changes over time.[138]    The part of a star visible to an observer is called the photosphere. In this layer, the stellar plasma is transparent to light photons. From here, the energy coming out of the nucleus spreads into space. Starspots are formed in this photosphere.    Above the photosphere is the stellar atmosphere. In a main-sequence star like the Sun, the lowest layer of the atmosphere is the chromospheric region, where spicules form and starbursts occur. Above the chromosphere is the transition region, where the temperature rises sharply at an altitude of only 100 km. Above it is the star's corona, where superheated plasma can extend for several million kilometers.[141] The existence of a corona depends on the star's convective region lying in the outer layers.[140] Despite its high temperature, the corona emits very little light. For example, the Sun's corona is only visible during a solar eclipse.    Above the corona, a wind of plasma particles is blown up into the interstellar medium. The solar wind flows out of the bubble region called the heliosphere.[142]    Fusion reaction pathways  Main article: Stellar nucleosynthesis    Proton-proton cycle    Carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle  The core of the stars varies according to the stellar mass and composition. various fusion reactions take place. This set of reactions is called stellar nucleosynthesis. The net mass of the synthesized atomic nucleus is less than the sum of the masses of the reactants. The rest of the mass is released as electromagnetic energy according to the law of mass and energy equivalence (E = mc2).[1]    The process of hydrogen fusion is sensitive to temperature, and a slight increase in the core temperature greatly increases the rate of fusion. As a result, the core temperature of main-sequence stars ranges from 4 million kelvins for M-class stars to 40 million kelvins for massive O-class stars. [143]: 41H â 22H + 2e+ + 2ne (4.0 MeV + 1.0 MeV): 21H + 22H â 23He + 2g (5.5 MeV): 23He â 4He + 21H (12.9 MeV)     These reactions lead to the following reaction:: 41H â 4He + 2e+ + 2g + 2ne (26.7 MeV)    where e+ is a positron, g is a gamma ray photon, ne is a neutrino, and H and He are hydrogen, respectively. and helium isotopes. Millions of electron volts of energy are released as a result of this reaction (eV is a very small amount of energy, so this energy is not large). However, due to the huge number of such reactions taking place at the same time, the stellar radiation is strong. nNeon.In evolved stars in kelvin, helium can be converted to carbon in a tertiary alpha process involving beryllium:[143]    4He + 4He + 92 keV â 8*Be  4He + 8*Be + 67 keV â 12*C  12*C â 12C + Ð³ + 7.4 MeV  The resulting reaction is as follows:: 34He â 12C + Ð³ + 7.2 MeV    Heavier elements in the compressing core of massive stars can also burn in the processes of neon nuclear burning and oxygen nuclear burning. The final stage of stellar nucleosynthesis is silicon fission, which releases the stable isotope iron-56. After that, fusion can continue only through the endothermic process, and the remaining energy can be released only as a result of gravitational compression.[143]    The example below shows how long it takes for a star with a mass 20 times that of the Sun to burn its nuclear fuel. For a main-sequence O-class star, this means 8 solar radii and 62,000 solar luminosities.[145]  Fuel  material\\tTemperature  (million kelvin)\\tDensity  (kg/cm3)\\tBurn period  ( year)  H\\t37\\t0.0045\\t8.1 million  He\\t188\\t0.97\\t1.2 million  C\\t870\\t170\\t976  Ne\\t1 570\\t3 100\\t0.6  O \\t1 980\\t5 550\\t1.25  S/Si\\t3 340\\t33 400\\t0.0315[146]\",",

It was in a temple dedicated to the god Zeus located in Olympia and was considered one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. From the 5th century AD. It has since disappeared, and there are several theories as to how it was destroyed. The figure was 12 meters and was carved in ivory. In addition, it included gold details and precious stones. The god sits on a magnificent throne made of black, gold and ivory, and is decorated with various reliefs referring to Greek mythology. The temple where he is located was burned by religious fanatics during the reign of Theodosius II. Excavations at Olympia did not reveal any remains of the statue, so one theory is that it was moved to Constantinople, where it remained until a fire destroyed it. was in Olympia, where the Olympic Games are held once a year. It was a series of temples dedicated to the worship of various gods, of which Zeus stood out more than the city.    Olympia was located in the region of Elis, in the northwestern Peloponnese. The temples that formed it were located at the foot of Mount Kronio on the right bank of the Alpei River. One of the most important temples in Olympia was the temple dedicated to Zeus, the father of the Greek gods. The religious building was built by Liban, who used limestone covered with plaster. According to the descriptions of the time, the temple was not particularly impressive. However, inside it was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World: the Statue of Zeus. Its size forced it to occupy the entire wide corridor of the building where it is located.    How was the statue of Zeus built? History  Most historians believe that the statue of Zeus was built by Phidias around 430 BC. However, other experts argue that this date may be earlier than 438 BC. Before Athena realized the height of the Parthenos.    As we mentioned earlier, the statue was inside a temple dedicated to Zeus built by the architect Libon.    The reason for creating the statue of Zeus was purely religious. Among the Greeks, the main deity was the object of worship in the temple of the city, which considered him its protector. In addition, the construction of the statue took place at a time when Olympia was gaining popularity in Greece.     The commission for the preparation of the statue fell into the hands of Phidias, the most famous sculptor of Ancient Greece, which proves the importance given to the project. The artist was born in Athens in 500 BC. C. and he was the author of works such as the Parthenon reliefs or the statue of Athena.    Phidias was accused by some enemies of his patron Pericles of keeping public money and was forced to flee to Olympia. It was then that he commissioned the statue of Zeus, which was completed shortly before his death.    Method of construction Very little is known about the method of construction by Phidias, and even its exact date at Olympia is a matter of debate.  \\ nIt is known that Phidias surrounded himself with a diverse team of artisans during the execution of some works, as evidenced by the archaeological research conducted in his workshop.    It was in this workshop that the sculptor drew his project and later gave the cabinetmakers the statue. ordered to make different parts. The next step was to prepare the ivory and carve it so that he could cover the parts of the statue that were not covered by clothing. In the case of Zeus, the whole body.    In order to work with them, the sheets of ivory had to be softened, and after this process was completed, they are thought to have been polished to shine and hide the joints.    On the other hand, the clothes are very made of gold or silver in the form of fine sheets. The quality of the final result looks like the statue was made of only gold and ivory.    History      The statue was installed in the Temple of Zeus at Olympia around 430 BC. He stayed there until 395 d. S    By that time, Christianity had spread and the ancient religions and gods were persecuted. However, in 382 AD. C., the decree allowed the temple to be reopened so that the population could contemplate the works of art it contained.      This opening did not last long, and in 392. C., with a new order it was ordered to close all pagan temples. Also, the Olympics were banned.      According to one of the existing theoriesIn 395, the statue of Zeus was moved to Constantinople, now Istanbul. His target was the palace of Lauso, where a fire before 475 destroyed the building and all its contents, including the statue.    Caligula      One of the stories told about the statue of Zeus is that he reigned between 37 and 41 AD. refers to the Roman emperor Caligula's attempt to destroy him. S    The ruler was distinguished by his arrogance and unusual and violent decisions, he ordered the beheading of all the statues representing the gods. Caligula intended to replace the busts with his own head.    The statue of Zeus was one of those condemned by the emperor, but his death saved him from beheading.    The legend says that the statue was responsible for beheading the statue. It is said that the soldiers came to the temple to perform their duties. At that moment, Zeus himself laughed loudly through the statue, and all those present, including the soldiers, were so afraid that they did not dare to approach.
